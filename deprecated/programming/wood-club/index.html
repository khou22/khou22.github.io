<h2>Wood Club</h2>
<i>I am the co-leader of Wood Club at my high school. Here is the progression of the club since the beginning of school until now. Historically, wood club hasn't been a very active club, but I wanted to change that this year! My co-leader is Nathan Craik, a junior at my school who is also a wood turning enthusiast.</i>

<h3>First Meeting</h3>
<p>Out of the 60 sign ups, we had 7 people show up...which doesn't sound like a lot, but is actually really good relative to some other clubs! There were 5 freshman and 1 sophomore so we had a relatively young crowd.</p>

<h3>Club Faire</h3>
<p>We got around 60 sign ups which I was really happy about! We handed out candy to whoever signed up and used our wood projects to attract the attention of passers by.</p>
