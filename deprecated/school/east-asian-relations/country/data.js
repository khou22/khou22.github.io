          "One common stereotype surrounding the East Asian countries is that the issues surrounding them don’t affect us U.S. citizens. Here are three case studies (out of many more) that prove this stereotype false. First, the East China Sea Conflict. Most of us Americans know that the Taliban, the civil wars in Syria and Libya, and the war against ISIS are all critical issues in U.S. foreign policy.  But many don’t know that territorial disputes in the East China Sea between China and Japan are just as high-stakes. Both Japan and China have declared economic rights in an exclusive economic zone (EEZ) 200 nautical miles wide, but these zones overlap as the sea is only 360 miles wide.  In addition, there have been ongoing squabbles between the two countries over a series of small islands called the Senkaku/Daioyu islands. Although leaders in both countries have been careful not to escalate the dispute, nationalism and mistrust among citizens on both sides make it possible that unauthorized military commanders on both sides could make the tension come to a head. In 2012, the U.S. congress declared that the islands fall under the  Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between the United States and Japan, and thus that in the event of an attack by China the US would defend Japan. This occurrence could potentially get the U.S. entangled in a war with China, and is thus critical to U.S. foreign policy.",
          "Korean reunification provides another case study. Although North and South Korea may seem like defined countries on the world map, their existence as separate entities is more precarious than clear-cut lists and foreign policy documents reveal. In fact, the interests of foreign countries, particularly the U.S., have played a large role as to preventing Korea’s reunification. Today China uses North Korea as a physical buffer between it and the U.S. The U.S., on the other hand, has stationed thousands of troops in South Korea so as not to allow China’s power to expand unchecked. The U.S. is interested in preserving this stalemate – just as in the Cold War era, we don’t want to jeopardize our security by risking a unified, China-friendly Korea. In addition, if reunification occurred, South Korea and global powers would need to provide a projected $3 billion to aid North Korean reconstruction. As South Korea’s most powerful ally, the U.S. would likely be forced to supply some of the money, and this economic cost is yet another reason why Korean reunification is not an issue to cast off lightly.",
          "Kpop and J-cool comprise a third case study. At first glance, the waves of culture which currently emanate from South Korea and Japan (including manga, anime, soap operas, and Kpop and Jpop) may seem innocuous. But the U.S. must pay attention to this phenomenon. In recent years, the Korean and Japanese entertainment industries have become vastly popular. This popularity translates into economic power, as well as cultural, or “soft,” power. For example, Kpop both adds $2 billion a year to Korea’s economy and has helped to transform Korea’s global image over the past thirty years from a crude, uncivilized country to a modern, well-respected one. Although there are Western fans of manga and Kpop, the Korean and Japanese industries largely operate in Asia independently of the West: the primary consumers of these industries are China, Taiwan, Singapore, the Philippines, Hong Kong, Thailand, Vietnam, and Malaysia. If the West wants to possess both economic and soft power in Asia, we cannot overlook the cultural power of Japan and Korea."

          "Here in the United States, we like to clump all Chinese, Japanese and Koreans into one “Asian” category. It’s simply them versus us. No one notices or cares when, say, Katy Perry pulls together bits and pieces of various East Asian cultures for her performance at the American Music Awards. But believe it or not, East Asia is not one homogenous clump. The counties of East Asia actually have a rich history of both rivalry and collaboration that has nothing to do with the West.",
          "The United States certainly does a lot of trade with China, Japan and South Korea. But most of trade between those countries occurs independently of the US. Here is a chart showing the percentages of each country’s imports and exports that come from and go to other countries in Asia.",
          "There are also numerous Free Trade Agreements between Asian countries that don’t involve the US. The ASEAN+3 (involving 10 Southeast Asian countries plus China, Japan and South Korea) and ASEAN+6 (which adds in Australia, New Zealand and India) agreements actually somewhat exclude the United States from trade in the East. It is true that the US recently regained some ground with the completion of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) agreement. But we are facing backlash in the form of numerous proposed agreements, such as the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) between the ASEAN+6 countries, the China–Japan–South Korea FTA, and the Free Trade Area of Asia-Pacific (FTAAP). These proposed agreements are being pushed especially hard by China, who was excluded from the TPP.",
          "In addition to having trade deals independent of the West, the countries of East Asia also have their own disputes. China, Japan and South Korea are all involved in ongoing conflicts over territorial rights to various islands in the East and South China Seas. Furthermore, issues still exist over past conflicts. China does not think Japan has properly atoned for its massacre of Chinese citizens during the “Rape of Nanjing” in WW2. And South Korea still demands more compensation for the damage inflicted when Korea was a colony of Japan (specifically for the “comfort women” who were forced to be sex slaves for Japanese soldiers). Not to be downplayed, North and South Korea are still at war! And further tensions in the region arise from China’s continued support for North Korea.",
          "Both the collaboration as well as the conflict between China, Japan, North Korea and South Korea contradict our Western assumption of a homogenous East Asia. So although it may be difficult for us to think about, we should consider the possibility that the United States is not the one and only concern for countries in East Asia."

          "Time immemorial East Asian countries have been characterized in the West as a place where people are “too good at math,” over-work themselves, and have lost sight of their creativity and happiness. Although this oversimplified and stereotypical statement may hold some elements of truth, East Asia is significantly more complicated and complex than what is presented in Western media.",
          "Despite the fact that each East Asian country have unique and distinguishable cultures, these four countries do share a deep appreciation and devotion to Confucianism. Perpetuation of Confucian values can be seen in many elements of Eastern Asian countries’ identities, including school, work, and nationalism. Confucianism teaches individuals to be unwaveringly dedicated to one’s elders, to be obedient, and to be more concerned with the group’s success than with an individual’s. Each of these values plays a crucial role in explaining some of the reasons behind the above stereotype.",
          "Although the stereotype that all East Asian work themselves to death is factually incorrect, Japan has started to see an increased rate of suicides among working age men. Also known as salarymen, full-time corporate workers have fallen into a hypnotising cycle that has become suffocating and restricting. These men follow a strict routine: they get up, go to work, work at a compact desk for many straight hours, come home to their appartments, eat dinner, go to bed and repeat this cycle every day. In 2011 the Japan Ministry of Health reported that over 2,300 people had fallen victim to mental health illnesses, over-worked related injuries or over-worked related suicides, as compared to 684 people reported in 1988. The current increase can partially be explained by the immense pressure salarymen feel to stay loyal to their companies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Especially since most companies hire workers for their lifetime, workers are deeply devoted so they fear disappointing their bosses, who have become like family, if they admit their unhappiness. Eventually, this devotion becomes so paralysing that these men feel like they have no other option but to prematurely end their lives.",
          "Salarymen are unfortunately not the only people in East Asia experiencing high pressure. In China high schoolers study for years to take a single standardized test that basically determines their success. Unlike the SAT, if students do not get a high score on the gaokao or National Higher Education Entrance Examination, their chances of attending university drop dramatically, and they will most likely be forced into hard labor jobs, and suffer under the knowledge that they disappointed and failed their parents who did everything they could to ensure their child would get a high score. In a New York Times article, 'Inside a Chinese Test-Prep Factory', one high schooler sums up his experience as “we have to do all we can,” Lin said. “Otherwise, we will always blame ourselves.” Similarly to SAT preparation, tutors and extra help can cost thousands of dollars, which many families in China cannot afford. Because of this unequal factor, many poor children have little hope to break their family's cycle of poverty. Conversely though, the families that do spend the money to better their child’s chances of doing well, create an all-consuming, tremendously stressful environment with a significant amount of unhealthy competition.",
          "Although it may seem that the East Asian countries are drowning with competition, stress and overbearing Confusion values, each of the East Asian countries has a thriving popular culture that continue to grow. Currently, both Japan and South Korea are experiencing unique cultural explosions known as JCool and K-Pop. Specifically in South Korea, K-Pop has expanded worldwide becoming one of the most popular genres in today’s music scene. K-Pop’s catchy tune is a hybrid between Western (uses English hooks and hip hop beats) and Eastern music styles which gives K-Pop a truly unique sound. South Korea leverages this soft power to successfully reintegrate itself into the world stage of pop culture while simultaneously helping its own economy as K-Pop brings in around two billion US dollars annually. In total, K-Pop is a fun, happy, Confusion valued based production industry that has captured the hearts of millions.",
          "Like the rest of the world, each East Asian country has significant problems of their own including, competition, pressure, and isolation. However, they also live in valued based societies that are creating whole new soft power tactics while simultaneously providing entertainment for their citizens in a creative and captivating way."

          "Because we live in a western country that enjoys many freedoms not universal to the world, we tend to think things about other countries based on some innate comparison to the experiences we have. This is neither unexpected nor bad, but it can get us into traps when thinking about countries that are fundamentally different than we are. China’s free speech and internet censorship policies are one of the easiest places to get caught up in western frames of mind, because the mindset in China regarding these topics seems irrational and crazy to us, despite it being perfectly normal in China.",
          "The most obvious area where we expect there to be issues is with free speech, because we always assume that in a country where that doesn’t exist, absolutely everyone who does will get taken in. That is simply not the case in China, where certain individuals--like the artist Ai Weiwei--have been actively trying to counter the government’s rhetoric. Of course, it is true that some of the most outspoken and revolutionary activists have been arrested, but on the whole that’s not the case, because the Chinese government has been very smart about this. They recognize that if they were to arrest their opponents in the most public way, then it would lead to problems, so in effect they just ignore them, and no one has a big enough following to make any revolution happen.",
          "Furthermore, the internet policies that China has put in place also seem tyrannical to those of us outside China, but within it, their view is very different. The young in China have never known a time when the internet wasn’t censored, and so they essentially don’t know there is something to miss. Because of the lack of western media and influence on the Chinese internet, and the replacement of the sites we know and love (Google, Facebook, Twitter, Amazon) with equivalent sites in China (Baidu, renren.com, Weibo, Taobao), they have no real need to look for things outside of China’s borders. However, they could if they tried, and that is another misconception about China’s internet policy: that they try their hardest to make it impossible to see banned sites. In fact, it’s relatively easy to get on a foreign site in China, if you know what you’re doing. I don’t, so I can’t really explain it, but the Chinese government itself doesn’t particularly care if individuals gain access to the outside world, they can’t exactly stop them, and if a Chinese person travels and then accesses the internet, they can’t do anything. They live in a big enough country that individuals with banned information can’t do much, so they let it slide almost every time. They focus on closing the biggest holes, and then let their independent volunteer army of searchers, the “50 cent party,” find the rest. These are essentially regular citizens who find instances of infringements on the web, and alert overseers who made them. They are anonymous, and a rather Orwellian group, but are independent. They only report to the government, and in reality they don’t find all that much, because the majority of China self-censors their web content, because they have no reason to act out; as I said earlier, they grew up under the censorship, and don’t truly know the difference.",
          "Essentially, to understand the roots of free speech and internet censorship in China, we have to let go of the things we consider universal and given, because they don’t hold true all across the world. The chinese are not in the US and have a very different culture to what we have, and so without understanding that fact, their relationship to those two areas will not make sense. All of the evidence above draws from those ideas, that China is very very different from us, and that’s why they accept the censorship and restrictions on free speech."

          "China is not taking over the world and isn’t going to defeat the US, at least not any time soon - China currently has too much of its interests tied intimately together with its economics and integrated into a global, modern-day economy that it risks imploding onto itself if it tries to do anything to upset the global status quo by so much that it becomes conceivable for China to surpass the US, both in terms of soft power and hard power.",
          "Comparatively speaking, a lot of China’s power is in its soft power in form of economy, not as much in military hard power. Despite frequent claims of Chinese military getting more and more powerful (which is true), the Chinese military is still decidedly less powerful than that of the US in almost all critical areas, such as nuclear projection capabilities and fighter jet engines. China is surrounded by countries aligned with the US (e.g. Japan, South Korea, Philippines) and is currently in the middle of a very difficult economic transition, so it’s has domestic issues to take care first. The Economist claimed that “It is a question of when, not if, real trouble will hit in China” with regards to a debt bust that it thinks China is going to have soon, showing that mainstream media also recognize the difficulties China is having with its economy (for further reference look at China’s reliably volatile stock market). There are many serious issues with the Chinese economy, and it may take only one of them to collapse the Chinese market and send it into turmoil. Furthermore, the most recent incarnation of China’s government is also relatively young and untested, and it remains to be seen whether it can whether all kinds of challenges, such as world wars and major economic downturns and come out better than before in a complex global environment.",
          "As for the “China getting richer than the US” hype, in 2014 the US accounted for 22.3% of world GDP, while China accounted for 13.4%. Another indicator showing the vast differences between the US and China is the total net national wealth of these two countries: in 2015 the US had one such net wealth of over 85000 billions USD, while China’s corresponding figure was slightly less than 23000 billion USD. It would take China a very long time, if ever, to catch up with and exceed the economic prowess of an established superpower like the US. Minus all kinds of structural problems, such as increasingly inefficient state-run giants (which account for the majority of China’s banking sector), centralized command economy blocking market-orientated reforms and the debt/high-risk lending issues all across China, China still has a long way to go to surpass the US."

          "It seems contradictory that Mao’s communist policies have been replaced with Deng Xiaoping’s more capitalist ones. While the government is communist, the economy is capitalist, yet the two competing ideologies have historically been so incompatible that a Cold War was born. From our western perspective, we find it difficult to fully understand Chinese economics because we are too focused on trying to slap either a communist or capitalist label on China as a whole. How does China reconcile the two ideologies and why?",
          "Deng Xiaoping looked at the historical success rate of command economies (economies that are controlled completely by the government), and realized that it was ineffectual, inefficient, and costly because no leader or group of leaders can be completely omniscient to know all the market trends from cabbage to shoes. This leads to shortages and surpluses which also leads to social unrest. Capitalist economies on the other hand are the complete opposite (although still very flawed), and dictated by the invisible hand of supply and demand. Because of Mao’s misguided allocation of human resources (telling millions of people to stop work and smelt useless steel in backyards or replacing doctors with high school students), an estimated 15 to 45 million deaths ensued in the Great Leap Forward. This is an example of ineffectual economic policy. In order for China to be a dominant world power, a centralized economy was not the answer, but neither was the overturning of a communist government that so effectively inspires nationalism. Deng Xiaoping came into government with a fresh perspective that contrasted with Mao’s diehard communism. “We mustn't fear to adopt the advanced management methods applied in capitalist countries... The very essence of socialism is the liberation and development of the productive systems... Socialism and market economy are not incompatible”"

          "Many stereotypes about Japan come from the country’s primary media export–anime, which are animated series that span across all genres and are directed at many different age groups. The common anime themes of innovative technology and their focus on kids and teenagers projects an image of Japan as a youthful, technologically advanced society–an image that is absorbed by many foreigners who watch these shows. While Japan is indeed developing new technology rapidly and effectively, the country has been unable to evolve and solve problems in many other areas that desperately need addressing. But what exactly are the problems that are plaguing Japan?",
          "One of the major problems in Japanese society is the working culture. There may be a stereotype from Japanese pop culture that Japan is all fun and games, but in reality, Japanese people work very hard. In Japan, there are salarymen (yes, they’re all men!) who work 16 hour workdays (they come into work at 9 am and go home at 2 am). Outside of working in the office, they are expected to go out and have drinks with their colleagues. The work that they do is often repetitive and boring, and the workplace follows a hierarchy based on age–that is, the older the worker is, the more benefits he receives, so workers are not rewarded based on merit. The overwork and stress caused by the salaryman culture contributes to Japan’s high suicide rates. Salarymen who work 16 hour workdays are vulnerable to feeling lonely and depressed.  Workers are expected to work through their depression by taking medication, and the unwillingness or failure to do so is seen as a sign of unprofessionalism. These workers constantly fear losing their jobs and being excluded by society, since the Japanese people still value lifelong employment.",
          "At the very least, though, salarymen have benefits and more stability in their lives, as they are hired for life after they graduate from college. However, after Japan’s bubble economy burst in the 1990s, Japanese corporations had to let a lot of people go. Japan’s economy has not yet been able to recover to the heights of the 1970s (deemed the high-growth period of Japan). Additionally, the global economy has shifted from a manufacturing based economy to an information based one. These two changes, combined with the system of hiring workers for life, has resulted in Japan’s corporations hiring less and less graduates as permanent workers. As a result, graduates no longer have the stable future that the previous generations once had, and many are forced to turn to temporary jobs. With Japan’s overall value and respect towards lifelong employment, most of these part-time workers are ostracized and plunged into the bottom of society, resulting in a sense of precariousness and hopelessness that may lead to death. In 1998, a total of 32,863 people committed suicide, a 34.7% rise from the previous year’s suicide rate and, at that time, the highest suicide rate Japan has ever seen.",
          "Since Japanese temporary workers are too often deprived of the benefits associated with full-time jobs and are typically not well respected by society, many of them retreat into isolation. Hikikomori are people who isolate themselves in their rooms for at least six months with no interaction beyond their homes. In Japan, there are an estimated 1 million hikikomori. While hikikomori are not a uniquely Japanese phenomenon, many of the factors that are contributing to the rise of hikikomori are distinctly Japanese. These include Japan’s hiring system and the significance of reputation in Japanese culture. Additionally, Japanese parents are reluctant to kick out their hikikomori children because they believe it is the parents’ obligation to properly raise their children.",
          "All of these aspects of Japanese society are contributing to a serious demographics crisis in Japan. As Japanese people are getting more isolated, there are less Japanese young people to support the increasing number of elderly. Less people are getting married, as the youth feel precarious about their future and therefore are unlikely to marry and start a family. Additionally, the work culture prevents real interactions between husbands and wives (husband are not even there for most of daylight).",
          "In conclusion, it is problematic to define Japan based on its cultural exports, as doing so will blind us to Japan’s problems. Even anime itself is contributing to Japan’s increasing isolation, as more and more Japanese people are becoming consumed by the alternate realities created by anime and Japanese culture in general. With Japan’s incoming generation showing clear signs of being less social and less inclined to marry, the promotion of anime may end up fueling Japan’s looming demographic crisis."

Over a hundred thousand North Koreans of all ages from the capital city of Pyongyang spend months training for the games in hopes of their group being picked to perform.",
          "What is fascinating about the mass games is that there is no one star performer. Instead, thousands of individuals perform synchronized movements, creating a larger masterpiece. The performance reflects the North Korean communist belief of putting the group ahead of the individual. In the BBC Documentary “A State of Mind” which follows two girls preparing for the mass games, one of the girls talks about how she continues to train for long hours despite being in pain because she wants to perform for Kim Jong Un and make him proud. Even though Un is often to unable to attend the games, all performers have the same goal of perfecting their act to impress him. This highlights the complete loyalty and deference to their leader that North Koreans hold. These are just some of the traits that make up the North Korean ideology: juche."

          "Juche, which translates to self-reliance, is an idea that was promoted during the 1950s by the North Korean government with the goal of severing Soviet influence and getting rid of Kim Il-sung’s political rivals.  The phrase Juche appears in the North Korean Constitution; in Article 3, it stipulates that “the North Korean government shall make the Juche Ideology of the Workers’ Party the guiding principle for all its actions.” Today, Juche Ideology is a tool used by the ruling class in Pyongyang as a justification of its dictatorship and hereditary power succession plan and as an excuse to close off North Korea to the world."

          "If North Korean state media is to be believed, the United States is in immediate danger of a North Korean nuclear attack.  North Korea claims to have a miniaturized nuclear warhead and long distance missile, the two aspects required to construct an intercontinental nuclear weapon.  However, those claims are dubiously supported.  In the past decade, North Korea has tested at least four nuclear weapons in underground testing facilities, a practice banned by the United Nations. Following the most recent test, the North Korean government claimed to have successfully detonated a hydrogen bomb, however international experts doubt those claims, attributing the 5.1 magnitude earthquake to a fission explosion, rather than a fussion reaction which carries a much larger detonation.  Similarly, as recently as April 29th, 2016 North Korea announced the testing of mid-range rockets that could be converted to project missiles.  These tests, as well others conducted two weeks earlier were announced as successful by North Korean state media.  However, similar to the reaction to the nuclear tests, other countries contest that none of the missiles actually achieved sustained flight.  Mid-range missiles are a focal point in North Korea’s claim to international security, allowing the target a number of East Asian countries home to thousands of United States military personnel."

          "“Our party and government will struggle to root out the danger of nuclear war being imposed on us by the United States, based on our strong nuclear deterrent and defend peace in the region and in the world.” - Kim Jong Un (5/7/16)",
	        "North Korea is a confusing player on the global stage.  On one hand, it preaches that it’s nuclear arsenal is simply a “deterrent.”  On the other, it is a country that releases videos of  Seoul and New York in flames.  Many view the North as an erratic country ruled by a dictator, believed to be just over 30 years old, who is treated similarly to a deity in his own country.  This is often attributed to an ignorant population scared for their life and a rudderless regime.  Upon further review, however, the North’s organization and international relationships all tie back to its singular purpose: to unite the Korean peninsula under a single, legitimate government.  North Korean leadership has used the international community to support its cause internally and externally.  Examples include the 1993 incident with the IAEA, where North Korea was condemned for its underground nuclear test and then threatened to quit the treaty.  North Korea takes actions like these to continue to show its citizens and the world that it is still fighting against the imperialism of the west.  WIthout that constant defined conflict, the North would be purposeless, and the continued hardships of citizens would be brought into question.  Now, the daily power outages, food shortages, and unheated homes are blamed on the United States, thus the regime must at least maintain the guise of fighting for their citizens.  They often use international forums to do this without the need for actual conflict, claiming every snub a victory against the west./’"

          "In 2014, a Human Rights Watch report concluded that “the North Korean government has committed systematic human right abuses at a scale without parallel in the contemporary world—including extermination, murder, enslavement, torture, imprisonment, rape, forced abortions, and other sexual violence.”  Political and civil rights are practically nonexistent. The North Korean government suppresses any form of opinion or expression that opposes it -- organized political opposition, independent media, free trade unions, and religious activity are prohibited.  To outwardly speak against the government or protest civil rights abuses is to “show insufficient reverence for supreme leader Kim Jong-Un or the ruling Korean Workers’ Party.”  Communication with people outside of North Korea is strictly prohibited; violators face severe penalties.  Torture by officials is common in interrogations during imprisonment. The death penalty can be applied for “vaguely defined offenses such as “crimes against the state” and “crimes against the people.””  Some people charged with serious political offenses are sent to kwan-li-so, which are brutal labor camps that Pyongyang refuses to admit exist. By US and South Korean estimates, between 80,000 and 120,000 people are imprisoned in the four remaining kwan-li-so."

          "The satirical film made fun of North Korea and Kim Jong Un as well as perpetuated stereotypes about the East Asia in general. Not surprisingly, the North Korean government was not pleased with The Interview garnering laughs at the expense of their nation’s image and openly condemned the movie. On November 24, 2014, Sony Pictures, the parent company to Columbia Pictures which was distributing the movie, was hacked. Confidential data including employee files and correspondences between the company and actors was released, prompting the release to be pushed back to December 2014. Although North Korea denies taking any role in the hack, officials told the Washington Post that North Korea was almost certainly behind the group, “Guardians of Peace,” that took credit for the hack. As the December release date neared, “Guardians of Peace” threatened violence reminiscent of the September 11th terror attacks if the film was released. As a result, most major theater chains decided to not to show the film and it was instead released to stream as well as in a couple of hundred independent theaters."

          "Cute. K-Pop. Plastic surgery. Ally. The good Korea. These are some of the things that usually come to mind when Americans think of South Korea. The reality is that the K-Pop industry, the history, the power dynamics, and the international relations are far more interconnected and complicated than they appear.",
          "Though it’s essentially correct to say that North and South Korea hate each other, the governments of both countries desire reunification of the peninsula. However, both governments have very different visions for the form that this unified Korea should take, and neither is very willing to compromise. This fact, coupled with an increasing apathy among Korean citizens about reunification from the growing younger generation that has never known a unified Korea, makes a peaceful reunification nearly impossible.",
          "The power and political dynamics of the region are further complicated by the nature of the relationship each country has with the United States. South Korea and the United States have been close allies since the ROK’s inception. After the major violence of the Korean War ended in 1953, the young Republic of Korea (South Korea) received large amounts of financial and military support from the United States. Today about 30,000 U.S. troops are stationed in South Korea.",
          "The relationship between the United States and North Korea, clearly, are far less amicable. There are no diplomatic relationships between the two countries’ governments, and the citizens of both countries tend to think about and understand the other country mainly through stereotypes. We in the United States tend to think of North Korea as a nation of irrational, war mongering leaders and citizens who follow their leader with blind and fanatical devotion. Conversely, hatred of America is a concept which is deeply embedded in North Korean culture. All of these fundamental differences foster animosity and misunderstanding between the two Koreas, making the prospect of reunification, or even peaceful and normalized relations extremely unlikely.  However, K-Pop may be a solution to bridging this gap.",
          "The beginnings of K-Pop stem from the South Korean period of economic growth.  Starting in the 1960s, South Korea began to gradually industrialize and soon became a major economic power by the 1980s.  However, the Asian financial crash of the mid-1990s exposed flaws in the economic system, so the government decided to implement a new strategy in the process of rebuilding the South Korean economy.",
          "Their strategy was cultural technology, which is the process of engineering South Korea’s pop culture to be as successful and appealing as possible. Today, K-Pop is deliberately designed and engineered, to the extent that the idols (the K-Pop stars) are made, not born. Idols are recruited by the entertainment companies, typically during their early teens. Once they agree to become stars and sign contracts, which are typically long term, they undergo intensive training in singing, dancing, foreign languages, and navigating the media. A K-Pop star’s life is highly controlled. Unlike in the United States, even the smallest scandal can completely ruin an artist’s career, so as to prevent any sort of drama, the entertainment companies impose all sorts of regulations on their artists, such as restricted cell phone and social media use and imposition of curfew.",
          "The majority of music and other media is produced by one of three major entertainment companies, which are guided by the government. The content of K-Pop is also very censored. Korea imposes strict regulations with regards to the content of adult themes, drugs, sex, clubbing etc. in their media. For example, when Lady Gaga went on tour in South Korea, tickets to her concerts were only available to people over the age of 19.  This leads to a lot of self-censorship among artists and an overall, juvenile, cutesy theme in K-Pop.  Additionally, K-Pop music is written and produced with an international audience in mind.  This means the music is often based Western electronic or hip-hop, and the dance choreography is largely Western as well.  The lyrics, too, have English interspersed throughout, which serves multiple purposes like drawing English-speaking audiences and making the music seem “cool” and Western.  All of these changes lead to a debate whether K-Pop is actually an authentic part of Korean culture.  Although some of the themes and music in the songs are originally Korean, one could argue that the infusion of Western elements makes K-Pop inherently Western.",
          "Despite these restrictions, K-Pop has become a very successful industry.  In 2011, K-Pop was responsible for $180 million in exports. It has also contributed to an increased interest in Korea and Korean culture internationally, as demonstrated by the  45% increase in U.S. college students studying Korean. K-Pop has also served as a useful political tool to bridge the gap between North and South Korea. Many people in North Korea have grown to love South Korean music and dramas and according to former South Korean president Roh Moo-hyun reportedly remarked that hallyu (the increased interest in Korean media) would someday reunify the peninsula. 	",
          "No matter how successful K-Pop will turn out to be in bringing reunification to the two Koreas, there is no doubt that it is a massive cultural force.  K-Pop dictates many of the stereotypes that paint the image that Americans see of South Korea.  However, when watching the bright, bubbly K-Pop music videos, it is still important to remember why K-Pop exists, and to keep in mind that it is not necessarily an authentic representation of Korean culture."

    content: "I’d always thought of South Korea as being this very democratic, happy state. Learning about all the issues surrounding artists rights in K-Pop and Syngman Rhee and his dictatorial style of leadership challenged my perspective."

  {
    name: "Killian",
    content: "I always thought of China as a country ridden by pollution and environmental concerns but it was definitely a breath of fresh air to learn about all of the strides they are taking to become more environmentally conscious, including the large role they played at the Paris Climate Change Conference and the funds they have allocated for solar energy."
  },
  {
    name: "Rachael",
    content: "In East Asia this semester, I was most struck by the fact that even though Japan has a  high life expectancy, low levels of crime, a strong economy, and modern infrastructure, the country is tormented by societal problems and many of its citizens are unhappy.  This information was very strange to me because I feel like the whole reason countries work towards these benchmarks is to try to obtain a better quality of life for the majority of the population."
  },
  {
    name: "Qiwei",
    content: "It was very interesting for me to look at China and East Asia from a Western perspective, as it gave me some broad generalizations that actually helped me to understand East Asia and the US better. I’ve always known things like China having a different definition of a government and Diaoyu/Senkaku Island being political time bombs implicitly, but it was enlightening to see it from a different, outside perspective that gave me new insights."
  },
  {
    name: "Kevin H.",
    content: "The most valuable concepts that I learned this semester were why each East Asian country had the stereotypes that it did. Prior to taking East Asian Relations, my perspective on the East Asian countries were largely the same as the general public’s. By learning about their respective social, economical, and cultural identities, it became more apparent as to why Japan is seen as “cool” or why China is considered a “polluted,” communist-ridden state."
  },
  {
    name: "Michael",
    content: "I think that one of the most interesting things that we delved into this year was our section about North Korea, as we learned about their domestic culture and values and how that influences their political/international representation. I found this incredibly helpful to breaking down how North Korea is portrayed in the media today and how that differs from their own perception of themselves."
  },
  {
    name: "Dixon",
    content: "The ability to “understand” East Asia is something that is incredibly complex, of course, and so that I’ve found most important is the knowledge that because we grew up in the West, our culture and worldview is fundamentally different from people in East Asia, and to understand how East Asians act we have to ignore our assumptions about how we think they should act."
  },
  {
    name: "Clara",
    content: "The most important thing I’ve learned, I think, is that to understand (or even empathize with) East Asia (or any place that isn’t necessarily familiar to us) you need to look at its history and ideology to rationalize why countries do what they do.  More specifically, I learned that Japan is not a utopia -- the hikikomori syndrome is something I’d never heard about it but found fascinating."
  },
  {
    name: "Aidan",
    content: "I have to admit that before taking this class I definitely fell into the trap of thinking that all East Asian countries were more or less the same. Now, I understand that these four unique countries have their own vibrant cultures, complicated relationships with each other as well as with the US and complex histories that help define the situation each country is in today. I also learned that trying to understand East Asia from a Western perspective can be hindering, so being able to use a multitude of sources to study East Asia is vital."
  },
  {
    name: "Jasmine",
    content: "For me, learning about the negative effects of JCool and how it contributes to the increasing isolation in Japanese society was particularly interesting. It was fascinating to see how powerful culture can be. I also came in with very positive thoughts about anime, manga, and other Japanese cultural products. Therefore, it was shocking to learn about the role it plays in Japan’s increasing loneliness and the impact it has on Japan’s national identity ."
  },
  {
    name: "Sonia",
    content: "Specifically, I think learning about Japan’s “JCool,” the hikikomori phenomenon, and the 3/11 disaster was the most interesting.  I felt like the anime and manga and Pokemon I had grown up experiencing was a façade that seems to be covering up some of Japan’s problems."
  },
  {
    name: "Caitlin",
    content: " Learning about the Chinese firewall was especially interesting for me. It pushed me to consider both how the Chinese and ourselves in the US access and respond to information."
  },
  {
    name: "Maddy",
    content: "The most interesting thing that I learned this semester was the concept of soft power. Going into this class I had thought China was the only country in the region with any global influence and so it was interesting to learn about other types of power and to see how Japan and Korea are using them to gain prominence on the global stage."
  },
  {
    name: "Luke",
    content: "I’ve learned a lot of great things, but most impactful has been the realization that modernization does not mean westernization. I did not consciously believe this before, but I had just been operating under that assumption. But while studying these different countries, I realized that there are more than one type of power and more than one type of way to interact with the world."
  },
  {
    name: "Tony",
    content: "I’ve learned to recognize my own bias and search for different perspectives even if they do not agree with my own.  Through a new lens, I saw East Asia as a much more diverse, complicated, and globally significant region than I had before."
  },
  {
    name: "Pauline",
    content: "I’ve learned to better understand the relationships between all the countries we studied, especially that of modern Japan and China through our studying of the Senkaku-Diaoyu dispute and how much history and importance can lie on 5 islands and 3 rocks."
  },
  {
    name: "Wiley",
    content: "I lived in Beijing in 3rd and 4th grade, and it’s been incredibly interesting to connect my observations from living there with a broader and more factual understanding of China and East Asia in general. For example, I knew there was bad pollution when I lived there, but now I know that while pollution is a huge issue there, China is also one of the world’s leaders in renewable energy."
  },
  {
    name: "Lizzy",
    content: "I was always upset that high school history curriculums focus mainly on European history when the global focus is rapidly shifting east. It was incredibly useful for me to contextualize modern relationships between East Asian countries with cultural and historical background (especially Commodore Perry’s arrival in Japan, and Japan’s subsequent takeover of Korea)."
