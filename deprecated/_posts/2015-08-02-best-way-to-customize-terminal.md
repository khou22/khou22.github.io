I just did a post on customizing your Terminal look and feel using manual commands in your .bash_profile file, but I just came across a puggin called "oh-my-zsh" that makes it so much easier. I literally just installed it and my terminal came alive. It looks loads better! It recognizes github directories, color codes different file types, and does countless other things.
<br />
<br />
You can actually probably just scrap everything that I said in my previous blog post (I'm older and wiser now) and just use oh-my-zsh. I installed oh-my-zsh on <a href="https://www.iterm2.com/">iTerm 2</a> â€” the terminal client that I use (and strongly recommend).
<br />
<br />
Oh-my-zsh is located here: <a href="https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh">https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh</a>
<br />
<br />
To install, simply use one of the following methods and type the command:
<b>Curl Method</b>
{% highlight bash %}
$: sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
{% endhighlight %}

or

<b>Wget Method</b>
{% highlight bash %}
$: sh -c "$(wget https://raw.github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh -O -)"
{% endhighlight %}

## Themes
You can download terminal themes and color schemes from their [GitHub](https://github.com/mbadolato/iTerm2-Color-Schemes). The files for color presets can be imported from `./schemes/". You can browse screenshots of all the color schemes [here](http://iterm2colorschemes.com).
