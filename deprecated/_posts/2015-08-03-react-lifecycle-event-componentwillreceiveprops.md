I discovered a pretty useful lifecycle event in React. I've typically only stuck to getInitialState, componentWillMount, and Render, but I jsut discovered componentWillReceiveProps.
<br/>

This essentially gets called every time the component will receive a new or updated prop. This is really useful when you want to set a state equal to prop more than once in its lifecycle. The syntax is:
{% highlight javascript %}
componentWillReceiveProps(props) {
  ...
}
{% endhighlight %}

Try this out when you can! It's really useful.
