I recently finished what is probably my last major wood turning project in high school. As this is my last semester at Lick-Wilmerding, I anticipated the need to end my high school career in the shops on a strong note. For that reason, I decided on an ambitious project: building a segmented bowl with my nickname, "KHou," inlaid on the side of it in a different type of wood.

I had come across a video on YouTube of someone who used the scroll saw to inlay letters of a different type of wood.
