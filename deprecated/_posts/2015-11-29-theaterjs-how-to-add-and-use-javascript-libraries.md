I am working on getting some neat, open-source Javascript libraries ported into my website. I'm trying to teach myself how to incorporate the pleathorea of user contributed libraries into my site. Over the summer, I taught myself how to use NPM dependencies â€” elegeant packages of Javascript code that would perform preset functions. With the millions of NPM packages out there, I wanted to use it in my own site.

<br />
Unfortunately, I haven't been able to build a compiler that would allow me to use NPM dependencies in my code. I'm still interested in using other people's code in my apps so I've resorted to Javascript libraries. I came across a really cool one called <a href="https://github.com/Zhouzi/TheaterJS" target="_blank">TheaterJS</a>. Here's a quick <a href="http://codepen.io/Zhouzi/pen/JoRazP" target="_blank">demo</a>

<br />
Turns out, the steps to import Javascript libraries are very straightforward and simple.
<ol>
  <li>Download the <a href="https://github.com/Zhouzi/TheaterJS/releases" target="_blank">library</a></li>
  <li>Move the file into your source code. It doesn't matter where.</li>
  <li>
    Link the '.min.js' file in the <\head> of your HTML file like so:
    {% highlight html %}
      <script src="path/to/library/TheaterJS-2.0.1/dist/theater.min.js"></script> <!-- TheaterJS -->
    {% endhighlight %}
  </li>
  <li>
    Now you can use the library by calling the functions defined in the documentation. TheaterJS mimics a human chat transcript. An actual demo can be found on my <a href="http://khou22.github.io" target="_blank">landing page</a>. Here's how to use TheaterJS's functions (this is the actual code I used on my landing page):
    {% highlight javascript %}
      theater
        .addActor('kevin', { speed: 0.6, accuracy: 0.7 })
        .addScene('kevin:Kevin Hou', 2000)
        .addScene('kevin:Welcome!', 1000)
        .addScene('kevin:Kevin Hou', 2000)
        .addScene(theater.replay.bind(theater))
    {% endhighlight %}
  </li>
  <br />
  Hope this helped!
</ol>
