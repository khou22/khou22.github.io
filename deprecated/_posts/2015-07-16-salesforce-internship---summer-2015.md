I've been interning at Salesforce.com for the past couple weeks this summer and I figured I would keep a section of my blog devoted to my thoughts, experiences, and anything that comes to mind! I've been working as an Engineer on the UX Design team. I started working at Salesforce on June 22nd and these past three weeks have been some of my favorite weeks of my life! I've met so many amazing people and learned a ton of new skills. It's truly a blessing to have this opportunity and I intend to make the most of it.

<br />

Here's some background on the kinds of things I'm doing/using while I'm working here:
<ul class="no-style">
  <li><b>Computer:</b> Macbook Pro 15" Retina from 2014 with 2.8 GHz Intel Core i7, 16 gb of ram, and a 512 gb SSD</li>
  <li><b>Applications:</b> Sublime Text 2, iTerm 2, Sketch, Slack, Chrome</li>
  <li><b>Languages:</b> HTML, CSS, SCSS, Vanilla Javascript, React, ES6, and a little bit of Angular in the beginning</li>
  <li><b>Websites:</b> Github, Codeschool, Codeacademy, W3Schools, Codepen.io, Heroku, Gmail</li>
</ul>

<br />

I am one of two high schoolers in the Futureforce intern program at Salesforce.com, so the learning curve is pretty steep. I'm doing my best and I've really learned a lot!

I'll be posting about various topics including bug solutions, life advice, and my perspective on what the corporate life is like (hint: free ice cream).
