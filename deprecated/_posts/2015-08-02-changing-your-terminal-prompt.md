I just learned how to customize my Terminal shell to my liking. My latest customization was to change the Terminal prompt. Typically, my prompt looked like:

Computer-Name: User-Name ~

This was just too long and cluttered my screen far too much. I set about to change this. Here are the steps to remove your user name:

1. Go to your route directory
2. Find the customizer file named ".bash_profile". This is a hidden file so it can only be seen by using "$ ls -a". If it is not there, do not worry, step 3 will both open and create it.
3. Type: "$ nano .bash_profile"
4. Type: "export PS1="\h: \w "
5. Now type: control + O, return, control + x
6. Restart your terminal

Your prompt should now look like:
Computer-Name: ~

For the cleanest look, use:
"export PS1="\W "

It will render:
~
