Since I'm working with the Javascript framework, React, I would like to have a syntax highlighter in my Sublime IDE. Babel-Sublime is just what I'm looking for - it is integrated with Sublime and provides syntax highlighting for JSX code.

You can install it using Package Control and feel free to check out my blog post to see how that's done. Here's the link to Babel-Sublime:

I highly recommend this for anyone working in ReactJS on Sublime!
