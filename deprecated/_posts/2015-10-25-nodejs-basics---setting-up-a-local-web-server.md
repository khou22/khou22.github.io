I'm starting a new project with a group of kids to program a plagiarism app for my school. After debating between PHP and Node.js, we decided to use Node.js as our primary ecosystem. After a bit of research and a couple of YouTube videos, I set up my own simple web server. My repository can be found <a href="https://github.com/khou22/NodeJSPractice">here</a>.

Here are the basics:
<ul>
  <li>Node.js in a nutshell runs Javascript locally from your terminal</li>
  <li>It takes Chrome’s V8 engine and uses it on the client side rather than attaching it to an HTML document (Javascript doesn’t have ‘document’ or ‘window’)</li>
  <li>Node.js can easily create a local server to compile, build, and emulate your web-based code</li>
</ul>

I worked briefly with Node.js over the summer at Salesforce.com when I was a UX Engineer, but I had never truly dove into the compiler I was using. I was under a lot of time pressure and was behind the learning curve, so I simply accepted what came out of it.

It's all coming back to me now and I'm realizing that I actually <i>do</i> understand a great deal of what's going on. Here are some basics that I used over the summer that people should know:

<b>Node.js and NPM</b>
Node.js also built NPM - Node Package Manager - which is the default package manager for Node.js. It is responsible for downloading, importing, and including open-source packages, or libraries if you will. These packages are largely user-contributed and can be downloaded and included like so:

<b>Terminal</b>
{% highlight bash %}
$: npm install [packageName]
{% endhighlight %}

<b>Javascript</b>
{% highlight javascript %}
var package = require([packageName]); //Includes the package content as an object
{% endhighlight %}

Packages are a super easy way to install predefined functions that can do common things. They're incredibly simple and easy to pick up.

You <i>never</i> want to include packages themselves in repositories. They take up space and are simply non-essentials. Because of the nature of open-sourced code, packages are mostly all available online to be installed by anyone. To share dependencies, you need to create a 'package.json' file — a file that specifies which packages should be included.

To create the 'package.json' file type, type (in Terminal):
{% highlight bash %}
$: npm init
{% endhighlight %}

To log a dependency in the 'package.json':
{% highlight bash %}
$: npm install [packageName] -S
{% endhighlight %}

If you wish to install all the packages specified in the 'package.json' file, simply type:
{% highlight bash %}
$: npm install
{% endhighlight %}
This will install all the required modules. This sytem makes sharing code incredibly elegant and easy!

<b>Including Other JS Files in Your Code</b>
It's very easy to include other Javascript files in your code. In fact, it's almsot identical to including a package dependency. Simply include:
{% highlight javascript %}
var m2 = require("./module2"); //Assumes js file
{% endhighlight %}

Must export your data in module2 otherwise it just reads an empty object:
{% highlight javascript %}
//In module2.js
var a = 10;
module.export.data = a; //Will export an object
//To access in other JS files, a will be stored as data.a
{% endhighlight %}

<b>Creating a Simple Local Web Server</b>

It's very easy to start your own web server to run compiled code. It's great for prototypes and running web apps locally. Here's a simple web server that highlights the basic functionality:
{% highlight javascript %}
var server = http.createServer(function(request, response) {
  //Every time server hears something at port 3000, will respond with this:
  console.log("Got a request"); //Returns in the terminal
  response.write("Hi"); //Sends the window content. The browser will display "Hi"
  response.end();
});

server.listen(3000); //Specifies the port at which it will be served
{% endhighlight %}

Hope this helps! I'll be updating my site with various Node.js content and updates on the Plargiism App. In the meantime, if you have any questions feel free to <a href="mailto:kevin.ch.hou@gmail.com">reach out</a>
