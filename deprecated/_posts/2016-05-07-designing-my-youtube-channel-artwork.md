I finally got around to designing my own YouTube channel artwork. Similar to a Facebook cover photo, YouTube's channel artwork is the second most important image to your YouTube brand. I had just released my first "high quality" <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZSztfYnnC8" target="_blank">video</a> and I wanted to improve the rest of my YouTube channel as well.

<h3 class="post-subheader">Design Process</h3>
I found a <a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-tjmufytBinc/UcvXPhPX8DI/AAAAAAAACYE/J8yVDWg25-I/s1600/YouTube-One-Channel-Template-Full-Optimized-(1).png" target="_blank">template</a> online that detailed the dimensions for each YouTube platform. For every YouTube client (ie. mobile, TV, computer, etc.), there is a specific cropping method. I used the dimensions to create a design that would look good on all possible devices.

I wanted to go for a minimalistic look — flat and simple seems to be the trend these days among digital design. At first, I wanted to incorporate some aspect of woodshop in my channel artwork. I tried many different methods, both subtle and blaring, to weave in my passion for woodshop. After trying and failing to add things like a wood background to my design, I decided to leave it out entirely. It would be evident for anyone looking at my channel to know that I loved woodshop. I didn't feel like I could produce a design that I was proud of if I tried to incorporate woodworking — it would be clear I was forcing it.

I looked at the channel artworks of some of my favorite tech and wood YouTubers. I found that YouTubers that loved wood used more image based, "stack"-style cover photos; however, my tech YouTubers favored the a cleaner look. Being a web developer and digital designer, I was in favor of the latter.

<h4>Desktop Browser</h4>

This is typically what a YouTuber user would see. This is the crop size for a desktop browser. A mobile device would be the same height as this, but the side edges would be trimmed inward a tiny bit.

<h4>Full Size (For TV Clients)</h4>

This is the full resolution image. The only time a user would see this entire image would be on the TV.
