A discovered another Mac OS trick that uses the option key. To crop a picture in Preview into a square, hold the option key and the shift key while dragging with your mouse. This causes the selection to scale proportionally.

There are two possible outcomes:
<ul>
  <li>If you have an existing selection, it will keep the same aspect ratio.</li>
  <li>If you have no selection, it will create a square selection.</li>
</ul>
