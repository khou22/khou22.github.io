I had the honor of delivering the keynote at the AI Engineer World's Fair 2025, opening for Greg Brockman and Jensen Huang. This was my third time speaking at the event, but my first time sharing Windsurf's boldest product vision yet on the main stage.

The full talk is available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVuNPL5QO8Q).

### SparkNotes: Windsurf's Vision

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Windsurf will be ubiquitous üß†**  
Windsurf will read not only your codebases, but also Jira, Google Docs, Linear, Stripe, Slack, your browser, and all the knowledge sources that make a developer successful.

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Windsurf will do everything üõ†Ô∏è**  
AI must take action itself across a wide variety of surfaces. Windsurf will interact with third-party services, provision API keys, write design docs, run terminal commands, QA itself, and much more.

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Windsurf on all the time üïë**  
We're building toward a future where agents can do 99% of the work, just asking the user for final approval. This will happen in the Windsurf Editor, asynchronously behind the scenes, in parallel codebase research, and running 24/7 while you sleep.

4Ô∏è‚É£ **How are we going to do this?**  
We needed a model that could ingest the entire SWE workflow‚Äînot just code generation. That's why we trained SWE-1, our own model, now rivaling the frontier labs. SWE-1's code is accepted at an even higher rate than models like Claude 3.7.

With millions of users, Windsurf is uniquely positioned to push beyond the boundaries of code generation and build at the frontier of what models can do.

I couldn't be more excited to be working at the frontier of the AI industry and sharing the magic of what we‚Äôve built (and will be building) with the world.

Special thanks to Shawn "swyx" Wang and Benjamin Dunphy for the opportunity to present and share the stage with some of AI's greatest innovators and leaders.

If anything I spoke about resonated, drop me a line ‚Äî we're hiring across all roles!
