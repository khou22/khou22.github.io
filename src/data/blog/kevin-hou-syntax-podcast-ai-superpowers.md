I'm thrilled to announce that I was invited onto the Syntax Podcast to discuss all things AI coding assistants, focusing on features like fast autocomplete, code context awareness, and data privacy.

It was my first appearance on a podcast and while it took me a few minutes to get over my nerves, it was an amazing experience. Hope you enjoy and learn something new!
