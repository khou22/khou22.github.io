## Introduction: Why the Ricoh GR IIIx?

The Ricoh GR IIIx is a compact powerhouse, perfect for everyday carry and street photography. Its large APS-C sensor, sharp 40mm equivalent lens, and pocketable size make it a favorite for photographers who value image quality and discretion. Here’s my daily setup, favorite accessories, and some tips and tricks I’ve picked up along the way.

### Ricoh GR IIIx Key Specs

- 24.2MP APS-C CMOS sensor
- 40mm f/2.8 equivalent fixed lens
- Hybrid AF (phase + contrast)
- 3-inch touchscreen LCD
- IBIS (in-body image stabilization)
- Compact, lightweight design

## Accessories I Use

- **Peak Design Cuff Wrist Strap**: Keeps the camera secure but doesn’t get in the way.
- **Extra DB-110 Batteries**: The GR IIIx battery is small, so I always carry a spare or two.
- **SanDisk Extreme Pro SD Card**: Fast write speeds for RAW shooting.
- **JJC Metal Lens Hood**: Protects the lens and reduces flare without adding bulk.
- **Gariz Leather Half Case**: Adds grip and protects the body.
- **Soft Shutter Release Button**: For a more tactile shooting experience.

## My Shooting Style & Custom Presets

- **Snap Focus**: I set snap focus distance to 2m for quick street shots.
- **Highlight-Weighted Metering**: Helps preserve highlights in harsh light.
- **JPEG Custom Presets**:
  - "Positive Film" for vibrant street scenes
  - "Monochrome" with high contrast for classic B&W
- **Zone Focusing**: I often shoot at f/5.6–f/8 for deep depth of field and fast response.
- **One-Handed Operation**: The GR IIIx is easy to use with one hand, great for candid moments.

## Tips & Tricks

- Use the built-in ND filter for shooting wide open in bright light.
- Assign "Snap Focus" to the Fn button for instant access.
- Keep the camera in your pocket, lens retracted, for stealthy shooting.
- Experiment with in-camera RAW development for quick edits on the go.
- Clean the sensor regularly—its compactness means dust can sneak in.
