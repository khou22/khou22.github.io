Proud to announce that [Codeium](https://codeium.com) has raised a $65M series B! The round was led by Kleiner Perkins, General Catalyst, and Green Oaks.

This vote of confidence and funding will enable us to continue building the most intelligent AI code assistant on the market and accelerate our reach.

Codeium is currently used by hundreds of thousands of developers every day, with many Fortune 500 customers and partnerships.

I'm proud to be a member of this team and it's been remarkable how far we've come in the last year. We are actively hiring across many areas (including engineering and go to market) — let me know if you know anyone who might be a fit!
