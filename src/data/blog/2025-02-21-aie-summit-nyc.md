At AI Engineer Summit NYC last month, I had the honor of sharing some of the secret sauce behind the magic of Windsurf and the team‚Äôs playbook for building the best AI products.

With the AI industry moving at breakneck speed, our lean engineering team keeps these core AI principles at heart in order to deliver a tool that developers will love:

1) Trajectories üîÆ: Windsurf reads your mind and can predict your next 1, 2, 10 steps.
2) Meta-Learning üßë‚Äçüè´: Like a pair programmer, Windsurf learns with you and your company's usage.
3) Scale with Intelligence üß†: Don't build product / infra to crutch today's model failures. Design your systems to inherit the gains when LLMs inevitably improve.

Here‚Äôs an example of these principles in action. When we launched Windsurf, we made the bold decision to delete "Chat" and only allow users to use the "Agent". Instead of a simple chatbot that relies on @ codebase, RAG, and 1:1 responses, we architected the entire Windsurf experience around our agent complete with codebase context, file edits, a memory bank, terminal execution, edit history, web search, model context protocol (MCP), and so much more. We are making a bet that models will improve and that the future is agentic.
