Some exerpts:

> Shivraj (Sunny) Sandhu ’20, Neel Ajjarapu ’20, and Kevin C. Hou ’20 have been friends throughout their Princeton careers. Before they evacuated campus, the trio gathered to discuss how they could effect positive change while stuck at home. They brought together Sandhu’s consulting background, Hou’s experience in web development, and Ajjarapu’s familiarity with fundraising and alumni relations to create “Tigers for Nassau,” a student-driven initiative to help local restaurants weather the pandemic.

> With support from local leaders, the Tigers for Nassau founders launched an application for interested students to join one of four teams: Student Pro-Bono Consulting Team, Alumni Relations & Fundraising, Partnerships Team, and Tech & Design. Nearly 50 students have already signed up.

> Thus far, the group’s first clients include Homestead Princeton, a gift, furniture and home décor store, and Small World Coffee.

> "Homestead has been a physical store, with physical sales, used to doing things in a more traditional way," said Hou, who serves as Tech Lead. "They took initiative to say they want to move to an online website where people can make orders. We’re helping them move their physical collection into a digital store."
