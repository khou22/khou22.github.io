>Kevin Hou, head of product engineering at Windsurf, said competency in three categories makes a "successful" engineer.
>Those areas are coding, knowing when to seek outside support, and the nebulous "metalearning," he said.
>Windsurf aims to replicate the processes of human programmers, he said at the AI Engineer World's Fair.
>
>Windsurf's head of product engineering believes proficiency in three key areas makes a successful software engineer — coding, research, and "metalearning."
>
>Technical fundamentals are first and foremost, Windsurf's Kevin Hou said in a presentation at the AI Engineer World's Fair in San Francisco.
>
>"If we zoom out and think about what makes you all software engineers successful, there are a couple of different categories. The first of which — coding-related. File reads, running terminal commands, seeing your history, even which tabs you have open inside of your editor. This all informs how to generate the correct code."
>
>Following that, there's knowing how to seek support from external sources, Hou added.
>
>"Things like going onto GitHub and viewing a past history of commits, maybe looking at a PR that is doing something similar to the feature you're about to implement, doing online searches, web searches, looking at documentation," he said.
>
>And finally, there's "metalearning," the Windsurf product engineering head said, which he believes separates the veteran coders from the newbies.
>
>"It's the idea of what separates a junior engineer from a senior engineer, from a staff engineer," he said. "These are the organizational best practices, the engineering preferences, that all get encoded into what makes good code."
>
>Windsurf, which produces AI coding tools for developers and was recently acquired by OpenAI for a reported $3 billion, aims to emulate all the aspects that make up the process of a particularly capable programmer, Hou said. Most of what human engineers do now, he added, the company seeks to automate — eventually making it so people are only responsible for the final approval.
>
>"Windsurf is ultimately looking to make software engineering "99% agent and 1% human," Hou added.
>
>"And as more and more of these timelines and workflows become AI-powered, it becomes possible to have Windsurf working for you at all times," he said. "Not only as you type and use autocomplete and tab, but also in the background — researching when you're working, fully in parallel, only asking you to approve."
>
>Windsurf did not respond to a request for additional comment by Business Insider prior to publication.
>
>As AI-assisted coding becomes increasingly popular, companies have already begun to hire fewer human employees. Early-career workers in the tech sphere have been hit particularly hard. In an ideal world, though, Hou said Windsurf will help make programming a more accessible process, not one that's devoid of people entirely.
>
>"We want to build this future where you can code anytime, you can write software at any time," Hou said.
