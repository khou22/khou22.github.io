Proud to announce that [Codeium](https://codeium.com) has raised a $150M series C! The round was led by General Catalyst, with participation from existing investors including Kleiner Perkins and Green Oaks.

This support and funding will enable us to double down on R&D and scale our market leading code assistant.

I'm thrilled to see the momentum Codeium has gained over the last year. It's been less than a year since we [raised our Series B](https://khou22.com/blog/codeium-series-b-announcement) and it's great to see the team and product innovate, mature, and grow.
