### Abstract

Codeium is trailblazing the next frontier in retrieval and hint: it’s not just embeddings. Learn what the next generation of retrieval looks like and how 1M+ developers are already leveraging this superpower using the Codeium IDE plugin for AI autocomplete, chat, and search. We’ll dive deep into how existing benchmarks are failing us, what it takes to serve our custom models at scale, and what the future of AI-assisted software development looks like.

Kevin is a full stack engineer by trade and a creator at heart. He is currently Head of Product Engineering at Codeium. Previously a tech lead manager at Nuro self-driving. Received a computer science engineering degree from Princeton University with certificates in entrepreneurship and statistics and machine learning.
