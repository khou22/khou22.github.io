Today is certainly a career highlight. I'm thrilled to present Windsurf: the world's first AI agent-powered IDE üèÑ

In September 2024, our team unlocked a massive breakthrough in codebase understanding, tool use, and harmony with the user. We called our invention Cascade. At the time, the Codeium extension (autocomplete, chat, and search) had amassed millions of downloads and countless 5-star reviews. We had earned the right to build an editor that could redefine the category and change the way developers code, forever.

Windsurf brings agentic superpowers into your IDE. While you type, autocomplete, and navigate a codebase, we build an implicit understanding of your intent (ie. ‚ÄúKevin is adding feature X‚Äù). This allows us to suggest multi-cursor edits (Supercomplete), point to the next file you should edit, and even complete your entire task for you by simply telling Cascade to ‚Äúcontinue my work.‚Äù

As someone obsessed with the intersection of AI, product, and developer tools, I couldn't be more proud to ship Windsurf to you today. Available on Mac, Windows, and Linux for free at [windsurf.ai](https://windsurf.ai).

Here's a demo I put together of how the product works:

  title="YouTube video player"
  frameborder="0"
  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
  referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin"
  allowfullscreen
/>

Some things that make it stand out from the competition:

- Intent based predictions and code generations
- An agent that can actually perform full codebase-wide tasks, even in enterprise-sized repos
- Truly AI-native features embedded into your IDE like debugging lint errors and chatting about highlighted code snippets
- Lightning fast autocomplete and inline chat powered by really good context retrieval
