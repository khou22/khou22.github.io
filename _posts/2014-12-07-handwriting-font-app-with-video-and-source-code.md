description: "Summary of my handwriting font app. It takes the user's handwriting, creates a font out of it, and allows them to type in their own handwriting. The file can be exported as a vector file and printed on the CNC Watercolor bot to mimic a real person's writing."

I recently programmed my own handwriting font app using Processing, a Java-based programming language. The program prompts the user's handwriting, stores it locally, then allows the user to type in their own handwriting. I spent many hours on this project, and I had a lot of fun making it! I was really going for a program that would not only be a challenge programming-wise, but would also be a great tool to have. The features include:
<ul>
  <li>Functioning typing interface</li>
  <li>Font size</li>
  <li>Support of multiple users</li>
  <li>Line wrap and backspace</li>
  <li>Numerous special characters</li>
  <li>Export a PDF vector file to be laser cut/fabricated</li>
  <li>One of the coolest parts about this project is the ability to print out what you've typed on a Watercolor Bot. This is a CNC machine that uses a pen to draw out vector files.</li>
</ul>

I was very proud of this program. I spent a great deal of time on it and I was thrilled when I finally got it to work. Because of the complex nature of this project, I learned a great deal about both programming in Processing (PShapes, etc.) and the Watercolor Bot. My attempt at programming a "simple" word processor also revealed how difficult and complex Microsoft Office is.
 
If I had more time, I would add bold, italics, colored fonts, underlining, a curser, spell check, better line wrap, etc.
