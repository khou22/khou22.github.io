Hello world!
{% endhighlight %}

This is my first blog post using Jekyll on Github Pages!

I've been maintaining a <a href="kevinhou.wix.com/projects">website</a> and <a href="kevinhou.wix.com/projects/blog">blog</a>, but I thought it was about time I transitioned to a real, coded website. One of my mentors for my summer internship at Salesforce.com, Seimith Suth, recommended I use Github Pages to host my website and use Jekyll to power my blog. I just got it set up earlier today and I'm ready to start porting my content over!

A big shoutout to Seimith for her help not just on this, but with all my questions throughout the summer. She's spent hours and hours helping me through my projects even if she has a lot on her plate. Thanks a bunch :)

I think I'm going to do a brain dump of everything Seimith taught me just so that I can remember it for personal reference. Lots of markup tricks, Jekyll tips, etc. Anyways, I'm really excited to get this going and I'll be following up with more blog posts soon so stay tuned!
