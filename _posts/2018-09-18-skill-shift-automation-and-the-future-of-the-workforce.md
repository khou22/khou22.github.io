# Shifting skill requirements in five sectors
* Banking/insurance - number crunching jobs will decline
* Social/emootional skills will still be needed for customer interaction
* Energy/mining - Manual work will be displaced as machines can easily run diagnostics, collect data, read metrics
* Healthcare - office support staff will decrease, care providers will increase
* Manufacturing - physical labor decrease, more leadership skills needed
* Retail - predictable manual jobs like driving/packing/stocking will decline as they become productive
    * Sensors, robots, automated cashiers, etc.
    * Decrease human interaction

# Mindshift
* It'll be a huage mind-set shift for companies
* The way they work will be must faster and more dynamic
* Might be a "new-collar" job that operates in between white and blue
    * People who don't get cut will need to operate at a higher level because a lot of their tasks will be sped up
* "Gig"/sharing economy will increase

# Future Workforce
* Retraining - in-house vs. outsourced learning opportunieis
* Redeployment - unbundling/rebundling tasks
* Hiring - sometimes less expensive than retraining
    * Europe is much more willing to retrain
    * US 35% of respondants said they would simply rehire or mainly rehire
    * Europe: 7% would rehire
* Contracting - bring in contractors for very specific knowledge set for noncore/low-skill roles
    * Not for "high-skill talent"
* Releasing - reducing work hours of some employees
    * Could result in a loss of culture, satisfaction
