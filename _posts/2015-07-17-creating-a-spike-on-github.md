In programming, a spike a place to test out various methods before actually coding the finished project. For the past week, I've been practicing with a whole host of components that I will ultimately use in my final project such as modals, lists, animation, React components, JSON data, states, props...the list goes on and on and on. I didn't want to lose this code because, believe it or not, it can actually be really helpful down the road. Sometime I'll forget how I did something originally, and I'll have to refer back to the previous file. To solve this issue, I created a Spike branch in Github.

I essentially backed up my spike so that I could reference it later on. To be honest, I'm not entirely sure what I did, but my mentor told me that I was backing up my code so I'll take his word for it. Originally, my spike was in my Master branch. I used this code in terminal to back it up:

Here is a <a href="http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/">useful article</a> about creating GitHub branches logically and neatly. It covers the importance of creating a good branch structure, especially when dealing with continuous development. Here is a cheat sheet: <a href="http://nvie.com/files/Git-branching-model.pdf">http://nvie.com/files/Git-branching-model.pdf</a>

Hope this helps! It's a good way of storing your work so that you can reference it later. You might also want to store a local version of the spike by downloading the zip file just in case.
