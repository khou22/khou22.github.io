<h2>Cutting Topographical Maps on the CNC Router</h2>
<p>This blog post is primarily for my own notes. It's a work in progress. As my project progresses and I encounter more challenges, I will write about them here.</p>

<b>Process</b>
<ol>
  <li>Import map from Google Earth plugin on SketchUp</li>
  <li>Geo-location → Add location</li>
  <li>Select show terrain</li>
  <li>Export from sketchup as a .3ds</li>
  <li>Import on Rhino as “Component / 3D Model”</li>
  <li>Set size</li>
  <li>Set Toolpath</li>
  <li>Cut “3D Rough Toolpath” first</li>
  <li>Cut “3D Finishing Toolpath”</li>
</ol>
