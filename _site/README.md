# Kevin Hou's Personal Website and Blog
Programmed in HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Ruby
<br />
Framework: ReactJS

This is the Github repository I use to serve my Github Pages site. This is my main website that I use to centralize my pictures, projects, apps, etc. All my previous websites and social media accounts are linked from this site including my LinkedIn, YouTube, and Flickr. I am continuously updating content so stay tuned. 

I started building this site in August 2015. I had been writing apps in Java and had done some minor web development before then, but I wanted to start an entire public website from scratch. It lets me not only continue my passion for coding, but also to pursue my interests in design, photography, etc. I am trying to teach myself NodeJS and AngularJS so that I can integrate these into my site.

If you have any comments, suggestions, or feedback please let me know!
