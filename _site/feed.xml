        <title>Slate: Taking My First Solo iOS App from R&amp;D to Full Scale Product</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./../../../../media/blog/images/Slate-Scheduler/banner.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I released my first solo iOS app, &lt;a href=&quot;http://slate.khou22.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Slate Scheduler&lt;/a&gt;, on the App Store a couple months ago. It can be found on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/slate-scheduler/id1221189245?ls=1&amp;amp;mt=8&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Apple App Store&lt;/a&gt;. Because of school and other commitments, I only just finished this blog post detailing the research, design, and implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;inspiration&quot;&gt;Inspiration&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inspiration for this project was that, as a busy college student, I was scheduling basically the same calendar events all too often and each time it would still take me an average of 30 seconds to do on my phone. I found that 90% of my scheduled events were “irregularly repeating” events, that is, they had the same event names and locations, the only thing that changed were their times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;post-line-break&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think about having dinner with someone. I’d have dinner with Person A, let’s call him/her Alex. Alex and I get a meal once a week when we can, generally between 5 PM and 8 PM, and typically at one of three dining halls on campus. As you can see, there is a consistency in options, but because Google Calendar or iOS Calendar only allow you to copy events exactly, there was no way for me to pick and choose which parts of past events I wanted to include in the calendar event for my dinner with Alex next week. This meant that I’d have to create my calendar event for dinner with Alex every single time, going through the monotonous process of typing in the name, searching a location, and using a hurrendous date picker for the time of dinner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;post-line-break&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frustrated, I took a macroscopic and critical look at the “mainstream” calendar apps, narrowing my painpoints to two main problems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Existing apps, like the iOS and Google calendar clients, were designed for completeness — migrating all features from the desktop to mobile — resulting in a bloated product that didn’t keep simplicity in mind.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The interface for scheduling events largely remained the same across all clients: date pickers, checkboxes, scrolling — a slow but accepted and standardized user experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided that I wanted to solve this horrific problem of calendar event scheduling by building a user-experience so simple and painless, that you would prefer it to your powerful desktop calendar clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;designing-the-user-experience&quot;&gt;Designing the User-Experience&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;research--identifying-the-problem&quot;&gt;Research &amp;amp; Identifying the Problem&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When researching, I discovered that every app pretty much has the same UI for creating an event. As someone who schedules four of five events a day, spending 30 seconds populating a form felt sluggish and irritating. I found myself increasingly annoyed at how limited the market was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;post-line-break&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certain features, that would feel natural to include, simply didn’t exist. For example, in Google Calendar, pressing “Done” (ie. the return key) would simply close the keyboard instead of focusing on the next logical text box below it. Pressing the location text box would take you to a completely new page — adding two more screen clicks than it “should” take.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;post-line-break&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like I mentioned earlier, another the huge point of frustration was the fact that once you pressed “Create New Event”, there was no way for you to check your current schedule simultaneously. No mainstream calendar client that I researched had this feature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;defining-the-challenge&quot;&gt;Defining the Challenge&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The challenge was to attack this basic task of adding a calendar event from your phone in a way that was quick, intuitive, and yet still powerful. I had to create a user-experience that would minimize taps, keyboard key presses, and especially, screen switches. Furthermore, I had to add the ability for users to see their availability on any given day so that they could view their schedules while creating the event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;formulating-ideas&quot;&gt;Formulating Ideas&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I approached my “solution” by looking through the eyes of a perspective user. What exactly do users want? What feels intuitive? Because I naturally have my own bias and style of scheduling events, what changes to the user experience can be generalized to any person wishing to schedule evets?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;post-line-break&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I first identified my core target audience. This app was to be a scheduler — used for frequent, but inconsistent events. The busy student, parent, or professional using this to schedule meetings, meals, and other random events, would generally have no desire to change their notification time, add guests, select a color for the event, add a note, etc. These are all features that &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; be useful on the desktop, but ultimately, wouldn’t be touched except for in specific edge cases. After asking friends, family, and coworkers, I found that this was consistent across the &lt;em&gt;majority&lt;/em&gt; of people who I would be targeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;post-line-break&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this in mind, I could then trim down fields that my user wouldn’t need: guests, custom notification times (a default for all events will do), event color, notes, URL &amp;amp; file attachments, free/busy selection, visibility, travel time (automatically taken care of automatically by iOS/Mac), and event privacy. This left the bare neccessities:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Name of the event&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Start and end time&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Location&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;post-line-break&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These three elements can be broken into two groups: text fields and dates. Text fields were an easier component to tackle, but it took some thought to generate a good date picking user experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;designing-the-text-fields&quot;&gt;Designing the Text Fields&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The text fields ultimately came down to minimizing the number of keyboard key presses. A lot of time is wasted typing the same event name and loction over and over again. I decided that every text field should have a list of text suggests based on historical data: events that you add frequently would have a higher liklihood of showing up. It’d be an autocomplete text field that would double as a search box of sorts (think Google search suggestions). This would make “typing” the names of events a matter of simply pressing the suggestion or searching then selecting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./../../../../media/blog/images/Slate-Scheduler/autocomplete-search.gif&quot; class=&quot;iPhone-screenshots-medium&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;post-line-break&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The location input would work in the same way. Most location search boxes direct you to a new, fullscreen search page which both feels annoying and takes longer. With these autocomplete text fields, all interaction could take place on the same page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./../../../../media/blog/images/Slate-Scheduler/ios-calendar-app-location-search.gif&quot; class=&quot;iPhone-screenshots-medium&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;./../../../../media/blog/images/Slate-Scheduler/slate-location-search.gif&quot; class=&quot;iPhone-screenshots-medium&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;post-line-break&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also wanted an easy way to prepend a room number or some sort of text before the location. With most calendar clients, because you’d be searching for an exact location, you wouldn’t have the ability to both search for a real location and add a room number. I solved this problem by splitting the location text field into two: a main location field with Google maps searching and a smaller text field to add a small chunk of text before the actual location.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;post-line-break&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another dead-simple, but unfortunately left out features is the ability to press the return key on the keyboard to move to the next text field. In Slate, you can easily zip between the required text fields. Pressing “Return” or a listed suggestion will take you to the next text field. Currently, the flow goes from event name to location and then to room number.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;designing-the-date-picking&quot;&gt;Designing the Date Picking&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of the clunky scrolling date and time pickers, I decided to take a more elegant approach and avoid this method as much as possible. Because scheduling events generally happens within the next week or two, I created a horizontal scrolling date picker that better served the goal of selecting a date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;engineering--the-implementation&quot;&gt;Engineering — The Implementation&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slate uses a predictive model that strengthens with usage to allow you to schedule calendar events quickly and easily without the painpoints of date pickers, multiple pages, and many other irritating, but commonly used, UI standards. I’ve built and will open-source many of the components that I built for this project including autocomplete text boxes and rounding step sliders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;post-line-break&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will not focus on the implementation as much simply because I’ve already covered a lot of the topics in other blog posts. Here are some of the few blog posts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-i-learned&quot;&gt;What I Learned&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learned a whole lot from this project both from a UX design standpoint as well as from an engineering, marketing, and critical thinking perspective. Unlike my previous iOS apps, I wanted to make this a fullscale, end-to-end project. This meant that instead of simply designing and building, I also researched, user tested, implemented Google Analytics, marketed, built a static website to promote it, asked my friends and family on social media to download it — in short, I took full ownership of it. This was not a siloed project that only me and 4 other random strangers would use. I wanted this to be a polished product strong enough to withstand any situation, clickpath, or permission error possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;post-line-break&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve built upwards of 20 or 30 coding projects to varying degrees, but Slate is definitely one of my most polished products. It gives me immense satisfaction and joy seeing people from all around the world using my app and even sharing it with their friends that I’ll never actually meet. It’s that knowledge that someone out in the world is touching my work — the thousands of lines of code that I carefully crafted — that is truly the fire that keeps me doing what I love: building for others. I can’t deny that I love coding for the sake of coding, but I believe a solution to a challenge can only be great, if there’s someone out there who gets to appreciate it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;acknowledgements&quot;&gt;Acknowledgements&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d like to thank my family and friends for their love and support during Slate’s development. To everyone who beta tested, gave feedback, and rated/reviewed — I give you a huge thank you. You keep me doing what I do and I can’t be more appreciative.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Getting Started with Login Sessions: Express, Client Sessions, and React</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-is-a-cookie&quot;&gt;What is a cookie?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A cookie is a piece of data attached to the header of an Internet request. It’s the browsers way of storing data about a website. A site might use cookies to track what’s in your shopping cart, when your last visit was, or who’s logged in to your site which is what we will be covering in this blog post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-does-it-work&quot;&gt;How does it work?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, the user logs in and sends their username and password to an API endpoint on the server. If authenticated, the server will send back and set a cookie with the session on the browser (ie. client). Until the cookie expires, all communication between the client and the server will include a cookie, or encrypted string, that can be used for authentiction, sessions, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;my-stack&quot;&gt;My Stack&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m running an ES6, React-Redux-Router client web app compiled with Webpack and served by my server. My server is an Express, Typescript, Webpack, NodeJS app connected to a Postgres database and Sequelize as my database API interface. My entire setup runs on Heroku.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;server-side&quot;&gt;Server-Side&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;middleware-enabling-cookies&quot;&gt;Middleware: Enabling Cookies&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We must first setup the infrastructure for cookies using &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;client-sessions&lt;/code&gt;. This involves using middleware to both configure and “enable” cookies. We use create a middleware with the specified configuration:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-javascript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;use&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;sessions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;cookieName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'session'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// cookie name dictates the key name added to the request object&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;secret&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'somecrazykeythatyoushouldkeephidden'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// store in environment variables&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;duration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;60&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;60&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// how long the session will stay valid in ms&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;activeDuration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;60&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// if expiresIn &amp;lt; activeDuration, the session will be extended by activeDuration milliseconds&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}));&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;secret&lt;/code&gt; key should be kept secret for security reasons. This serves as the encryption method for the cookie contents. Because a cookie is just a string attached to a header, it can be theoretically available to the public; however, you don’t want your user or curious browsers to see what you are setting as it could contain sensitive information. It often contains email addresses, authentication tokens, and if the developer really has no sense of security, passwords.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to keep all this information confidential, we use a long string as our key and perform an LFSR (Linear Feedback Shift Register) — an effective type of encryption. Because the key is stored on the server (keep it as an &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;process.env&lt;/code&gt; variable if your code is open-source), the server can decrypt it as well. If you are curious about LFSR, feel free to check out a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/khou22/Coding-Techniques-and-Algorithms/blob/master/Linear%20Feedback%20Shift%20Register.py&quot;&gt;version I wrote&lt;/a&gt; in python.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;restricting-access-based-on-cookies&quot;&gt;Restricting access based on cookies&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once a cookie is set, you can easily use this cookie to restrict access to various parts of your app. &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;client-sessions&lt;/code&gt; handles the decryption so the cooke simply becomes another variable that you can read in that is attached to the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;request&lt;/code&gt; variable in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Express&lt;/code&gt;. Instead of adding logic to every individual route or controller, I added my authentication logic to my middleware like so:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-javascript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;use&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;next&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// APIs that client must be logged in for&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Best practice: APIs that are accessible via the client but require a login&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// APIs are already protected by a Basic Auth, this is just a safegaurd&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;blacklisted&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'\/api\/users\/create'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;path&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;originalUrl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;session&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'No session'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;RegExp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;blacklisted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;join&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'|'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'i'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;test&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// If on the blacklist&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;401&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;send&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'Please log in'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Allowed&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;next&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;next&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because I already encrypt my server and client with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication&quot;&gt;Basic Authentication&lt;/a&gt;, I did not need to have restricted access on every part of my app. I instead created a blacklist of url regexes that require authentication. If a request is made to that URL or set of URLs, the request will be cut short and a 401 unauthorized response will be returned telling the user/client ot log in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;client-side&quot;&gt;Client-Side&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;logging-in&quot;&gt;Logging In&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to set a cookie on the client-side, we need a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/api/login&lt;/code&gt; endpoint that checks against a database of users and sets a cookie. I’m using &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Sequelize&lt;/code&gt; so the database management is fairly straightforward. My login route hits this function below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-javascript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;login&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;express&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Takes in values in the body&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;username&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;undefined&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;||&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;password&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;undefined&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Empty authentication&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;send&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;success&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'Please submit a username and password'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Error with sequelize&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;catch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;Error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

                &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Error in request&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;set-a-browser-cookie-from-an-api-response&quot;&gt;Set a browser cookie from an API response&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we know how to send a cookie back from the server, we must now inject that cookie into the browser so the session can actually be tied to a browser. The &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;client-session&lt;/code&gt; package automatically sets the appropriate cookie on the response header as &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Set-Cookie&lt;/code&gt;. This indicates to the browser to store the response as a cookie. Any response with the property &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Set-Cookie&lt;/code&gt;, as seen below, will do just that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;iPhone-screenshots-large&quot; src=&quot;./../../../../media/blog/images/set-cookie-response.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order for the client to allow setting a cookie, the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;fetch&lt;/code&gt; request must be &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;same-origin&lt;/code&gt;. This is a security feature that ensures malicious cookies have a harder time. I’m using &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;whatwg-fetch&lt;/code&gt; and in my fetch request, I set &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;credentials: 'same-origin'&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-javascript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;fetch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;method&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'POST'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
   	&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;headers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
   		&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;Accept&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'application/json'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
	   	&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Content-Type&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;application/json&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;credentials&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'same-origin'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Will set cookie 'set-cookie' only if this is set to 'same-origin'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this situtation, there was a successful login from the login page that sent back a cookie. The browser set this cookie in the header so every request to my domain will include this cookie in the future — at least until it expires. The cookie was encrypted on the server side and can only be decrypted by the server. It also has an expiration date so a user’s session will expire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;logging-out&quot;&gt;Logging Out&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Logging out is much more straightforward. It simply involves removing the cookie from the headers — thus reseting the cookie on the client-side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-javascript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;logout&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;express&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;previousUser&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;session&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Save the previous user&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;session&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;reset&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Reset the cookies&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Response to client&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;send&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;success&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;previousUser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;getting-user-information-after-load&quot;&gt;Getting User Information after Load&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cookies only allow information to be sent back from the server, so we need a seperate method to get information &lt;em&gt;about&lt;/em&gt; the user like their name, email, etc. We do this by creating a method that returns unencrypted data about the user based on the session cookie. It’s also a helpful API for determining if a user is currently signed in. Here’s an example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-javascript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;currentUser&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;express&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;session&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;delete&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;session&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Remove password&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;logged_in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;session&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;send&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;logged_in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;send&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my React-Redux-Router app, I make this API request on entry so that my local redux state contains information about my user right on load. This allows me to populate sections of my app like a ‘Profile’ section as well as restricting certain routes.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>React Redux Tutorial: Building Your Own Web App</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Redux has been making a strong appearance recently in the world of web development. In a nutshell, it is essentially a way of keeping and consolidating props outside of the React components. The goal is to eliminate the need for local states and use the React components for purely rendering and small minor helper functions. The creators of Redux set out to tackle the challenge many developers faced, myself included, of passing properties between many components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been working with React since it’s birth for about 3 years now and I’ve been a huge fan ever since. I started using Redux this past summer at Moat (Now Oracle as of August 1st) and it’s been a great addition to my skillset and productivity because of the ways in which it improves large-scale React web apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post, I will cover the basics of React/Redux as well as its benefits. Redux works by using React components, containers, actions, and reducers. Reducers receive action dispatches and update the Redux state. All Redux state changes must be routed through the reducer. Additionally, all actions must be connected to components through containers. Component can only update the local state by triggering actions. In short, reducers sit on top of the state, actions triggers reducers, containers connect components with states as well as actions, and components display client-facing components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;overview&quot;&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;typical-file-structure&quot;&gt;Typical file structure:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// This imports a redux store that we will get into next&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;store&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'./ConfigureStore.js'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// I've found it helpful to use a generic entry container that houses subsequent containers&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Entry&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'./Containers/EntryContainer'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;middlewares&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;push&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;loggerMiddleware&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Add middleware&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Creates store that handles the complete state tree of app&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// This is exported and used by the provider&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;createStore&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;mainReducer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;applyMiddleware&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;middlewares&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-creating-a-component&quot;&gt;3. Creating a Component&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Components are the purely frontend, client-side rendering piece of the puzzle. They should have limited logic and mainly act as pure functions. They are connected to containers which feed them props, but for now we will simply be creating a component with property requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pure Functional Component (Just Rendering)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-javascript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// client/src/Components/&amp;lt;folder-name&amp;gt;/&amp;lt;component-name&amp;gt;.jsx&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;React&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'react'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;PropTypes&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'prop-types'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// For enforcing prop types&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'../../Styles/&amp;lt;component-name&amp;gt;.scss'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Import the corresponding stylesheet&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ComponentName&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sr&quot;&gt;/div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Declare which props are what type and if they are optional&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ComponentName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;propTypes&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;PropTypes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;isRequired&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;someObject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;PropTypes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;shape&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;PropTypes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;isRequired&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;age&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;PropTypes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;numbers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;PropTypes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;arrayOf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;PropTypes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;isRequired&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Not required&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ComponentName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More Logic-Heavy Component&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-javascript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// client/src/Components/&amp;lt;folder-name&amp;gt;/&amp;lt;component-name&amp;gt;.jsx&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;React&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Component&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'react'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Must import the Component class type&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'../../Styles/&amp;lt;component-name&amp;gt;.scss'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Import sass file for this component&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Loading&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Component&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;constructor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Can now use other functions&lt;/span&gt;

		&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

	&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;randomFunction&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;input&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

	&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;render&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
  			&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          	&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sr&quot;&gt;/div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;       &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ComponentName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;propTypes&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ComponentName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;4-action-types&quot;&gt;4. Action Types&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All actions must dispatch an object that dictates to a reducer what it should do. The way the reducer registers what type of logic to carry out is by a unique &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;action.type&lt;/code&gt;. These are stored in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Constants/MainActionTypes.js&lt;/code&gt; file. It looks something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-javascript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// client/src/Constants/MainActionTypes.js&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Loading Actions&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;REQUEST_SENT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'REQUEST_SENT'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;REQUEST_SUCCESS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'REQUEST_SUCCESS'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// API Actions&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;5-reducers&quot;&gt;5. Reducers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reducers respond to actions when they dispatch a return object. These objects are picked up by the reducers and some logic is carried out that can update the state. Reducer functionality should be kept at a minimum and it is very important that they remain pure-functions — that is, they only rely on input, no other information, for calculating an output. A reducer looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-javascript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// client/src/Reducers/SomeReducer.js&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// This gives you access to the action types we created in step 4&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;types&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'../Constants/MainActionTypes'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;initialState&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;someValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Default initial state for this variable&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;someReducer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;state&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;initialState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;action&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// The app can decide what to do based on the action type&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// The return object for this function will be the new state&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;switch&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;action&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
       &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;types&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;SOME_ACTION_TYPE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
           &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
               &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;state&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
               &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;someValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
           &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
       &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Default, no state change&lt;/span&gt;
           &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;state&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;state&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;someReducer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reducers are then consolidated into one file in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Reducers/index.js&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-javascript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// client/src/Reducers/index.js&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;combineReducers&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'redux'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Import all the reducers&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;someReducer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'./someReducer'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;anotherReducer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'./anotherReducer'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Export for use in the entry index.js file&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;combineReducers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// 'name' refers to the name of the reducer you will use to access the variables associated with it&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;someReducer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;another&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;anotherReducer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;6-actions&quot;&gt;6. Actions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actions are like any function except that the only thing that really matters is their return object. Actions are dispatched (thanks to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;redux-thunk&lt;/code&gt;) and their return objects are what the reducers receive and interpret; therefore, it is imperitive that the action return has &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;type&lt;/code&gt; value associated with it. We will set them using the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;MainActionTypes.js&lt;/code&gt; constants we wrote earlier so that there are no typos. Actions are generally referenced in the container and attached to a component as a prop as we’ll see in step 7.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Standard action:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-javascript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// client/src/Actions/mainActions.js&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'whatwg-fetch'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Fetch requests&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;types&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'../Constants/MainActionTypes'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;updatingVariables&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;val&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;types&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;SOME_ACTION&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;val&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sample async fetch-request:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-javascript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// client/src/Actions/mainActions.js&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'whatwg-fetch'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Fetch requests&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;types&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'../Constants/MainActionTypes'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;fetchJSON&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;url&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'...'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

   &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Returning a promise allows you to use the 'dispatch' function in the child scope&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;dispatch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
       &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;dispatch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;requestSent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;));&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Actions can dispatch other actions&lt;/span&gt;

		&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Return the contents of the fetch promise&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;fetch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// See watwg-fetch for docs&lt;/span&gt;
           &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;credentials&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'same-origin'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// If same origin&lt;/span&gt;
       &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;response&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;())&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Parse response&lt;/span&gt;
       &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;json&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
           &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'Received data'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
           &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;dispatch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;receivedData&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
           &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Return it as a promise — will be the result of the original action&lt;/span&gt;
           &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Example:&lt;/span&gt;
           &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;//	 this.props.fetchJSON().then((response) { ... }).catch((error) { ...});&lt;/span&gt;
       &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
       &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;catch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;error&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Catch any errors&lt;/span&gt;
           &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;dispatch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;actionError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
       &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;7-containers&quot;&gt;7. Containers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Containers put steps 3-5 together and lets you package the component, reducer, and constants all together. Containers connect the actions, redux state values, and reducers to the components as props. When you want to render the contents of the container, you include the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;ContainerName /&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; as opposed to its child &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;ComponentName /&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-javascript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// client/src/Containers/someContainer.js&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;connect&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'react-redux'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Get the component&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;SomeComponent&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'../Components/SomeComponent'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Import actions you'd like to make usable to a component&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;someAction&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'../Actions/MainActions'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Map the redux states to props&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;mapStateToProps&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;state&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// 'name' is the name of the reducer you specified in step 5 in the file:&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// client/src/Reducers/index.js&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;someValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;state&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;someValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Map actions to props&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;mapDispatchToProps&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;dispatch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;viewComponent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;input&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;dispatch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;someAction&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;input&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Connects your component to the store using the previously defined functions&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;connect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;mapStateToProps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Add the states&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;mapDispatchToProps&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Add the actions&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;SomeComponent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Connect them to the component&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To use the container, simply include it like so:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-javascript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;React&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Component&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'react'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;PropTypes&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'prop-types'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;SomeContainer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'../Containers/SomeContainer'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Get container&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Entry&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Component&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;constructor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
   		&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;super&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

   &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;render&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      	&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
           &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
               &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;SomeContainer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
           &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sr&quot;&gt;/div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;       &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Entry&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;propTypes&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Entry&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you put all those pieces together you should end up with your first, boilerplate React/Redux application! It’s a really useful tool and a great addition to any stack — especially those that already use React. I will be working with this stack very shortly on a personal project as well as some business projects so I’ll be sure to keep you all updated on what I’ll continue to learn!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Swift Classes August 2017: Classes, Subclasses, and Protocols</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;swift-classes-august-2017-classes-subclasses-and-protocols&quot;&gt;Swift Classes August 2017: Classes, Subclasses, and Protocols&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;classes&quot;&gt;Classes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post, I will cover the basics of Swift classes, subclasses, and their protocols/delegates. Classes are a foundational piece of computer science and software development. They allow developers to create &lt;em&gt;instances&lt;/em&gt; of a certain type of object with pre-defined methods (functions) and instance variables (properties). For example, a class might be a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;car&lt;/code&gt; with an instance variable: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;wheels = 4&lt;/code&gt; and a method: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;driveForward()&lt;/code&gt;. Here is what it would look like in Swift 3:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-swift highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Declaration&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Car&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Immutable and only accessible within this class&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// No initial value&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;wheels&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Int&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Mutable and accessible outside of this class&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Initial value 1&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;passengers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Called when a new instance of &quot;Car&quot; is created&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;init&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;wheels&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;wheels&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;wheels&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Set instance variable&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Can be called on an instance of &quot;Car&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;driveForward&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Usage&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;porche&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Car&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Car&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;wheels&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;porche&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;passengers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// 1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;porche&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;driveForward&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// ...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All cars have wheels and they all the ability to drive forward — that is why these become part of the class. Classes are a way of standardizing objects that have similar properties, just different values. This method of creating classes is what allows for modular-code, an essential aspect of computing and engineering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;subclasses&quot;&gt;Subclasses&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subclasses are a way of building on top of existing classes. For example, if we continue with our example of the class &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Car&lt;/code&gt;, a subclass could be &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Tesla&lt;/code&gt;. They share very similar properties, but Tesla’s have key features that set them apart from cars. &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Tesla&lt;/code&gt; would inherit all the essential properties and methods from &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Car&lt;/code&gt;, but add on its own special components. Here is an example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-swift highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Tesla&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Car&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Inherit &quot;Car&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;charge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any instance of Tesla would still have the same constructor and properties like &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;wheels&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;driveForward()&lt;/code&gt;, but would include a new method &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;charge()&lt;/code&gt; unique to instances of type &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Tesla&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;protocols--delegates&quot;&gt;Protocols &amp;amp; Delegates&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protocols are a way of enforcing a parent or other class conforms to a set of methods. It’s a somewhat complicated topic and it makes the most sense once you’ve worked with Swift for a little bit, but here are some easy example.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br class=&quot;post-line-break&quot; /&gt;
The easiest example of a protocol is when you create a sublcass of a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;UIViewController&lt;/code&gt;. By subclassing, you are adding on top of the existing class &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;UIViewController&lt;/code&gt;. You are also given the option to override certain functions like &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;viewDidLoad()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;viewDidLayoutSubviews()&lt;/code&gt;. These methods are optional protocols in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;UIViewController&lt;/code&gt; made available to you because the delegate — what is responsible for satisfying the protocols — is set to the new subclass.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br class=&quot;post-line-break&quot; /&gt;
That’s all very confusing, but here’s a step by step on how they work and how to create your own class with protocols. It might clear up your confusion.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br class=&quot;post-line-break&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Create a class that has an event listener.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;language-swift highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;SomeClass&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;UIButton&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;UIButton&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;

     &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;

     &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;buttonPressed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
         &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;I was pressed&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This function, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;buttonPressed()&lt;/code&gt;, will be run every time the button is pressed. This begs the question, how will the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;UIViewController&lt;/code&gt; that contains an instance of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;SomeClass&lt;/code&gt; detect when the button was pressed? It can create an interval timer that checks every 1/10 of a second to see if the button state has changed, but that’s neither efficient nor practical. Instead we must use a protocol.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br class=&quot;post-line-break&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Create a protocol.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;language-swift highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;protocol&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;SomeDelegate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;buttonWasPressed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;someValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Passes back a parameter&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

 &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;@objc&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;protocol&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;SomeDelegate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
 	&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;@objc&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;optional&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;buttonWasReleased&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Optional protocol&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Notice the first protocol passes back a value. This is useful when you want the parent to be able to listen and track when a specific value has changed. You can simply trigger the protocol every time the value is changed and pass the value as the parameter. The second protocol example doesn’t take a paramter, but it is optional. This means that the parent class doesn’t need to include &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;buttonWasReleased()&lt;/code&gt; in order to conform to the protocol &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;SomeDelegate&lt;/code&gt;. Notice the use of the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;@objc&lt;/code&gt; tags.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br class=&quot;post-line-break&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Establish the protocol as an instance variable named &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;delegate&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;language-swift highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;SomeClass&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;weak&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;delegate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;SomeDelegate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;post-line-break&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Call the appropriate protocol method in your class to trigger the listener.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;language-swift highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;SomeClass&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

     &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;

     &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;buttonPressed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
         &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;I was pressed&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
         &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;delegate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;buttonWasPressed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;someValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

         &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// For optional protocols&lt;/span&gt;
         &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;delegate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;buttonWasReleased&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;?()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Optional so don't force otherwise app will crash&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This new line triggers the protocol method &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;buttonWasPressed&lt;/code&gt; and passes the value &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; up to the parent. Now we’ll cover how to actually use this in your class.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br class=&quot;post-line-break&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In your &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;UIViewController&lt;/code&gt; subclass, add the protocol as a class to conform to.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;language-swift highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;SomeViewController&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;UIViewController&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;SomeDelegate&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;post-line-break&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Connect or create the instance of the class and attach &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;self&lt;/code&gt; as the delegate. This will tell the protocol that this current class will conform to the protocol.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;language-swift highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;SomeViewController&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;UIViewController&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;SomeDelegate&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;override&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;viewDidLoad&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
         &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;super&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;viewDidLoad&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
         &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;example&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;SomeClass&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;SomeClass&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
         &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;example&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;delegate&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;post-line-break&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Add the protocol as a function. If everything was set up correctly, the method should auto-complete.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;language-swift highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;SomeViewController&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;UIViewController&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;SomeDelegate&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

     &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;

     &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;buttonWasPressed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;someValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
         &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Button was pressed with value: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;someValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;post-line-break&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s it! Now every time the function &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;buttonPressed()&lt;/code&gt; is run, it will run &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;buttonWasPressed()&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;SomeViewController&lt;/code&gt; and pass a value. This is a great way of communicating between a child and parent when some event is triggered by the user.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br class=&quot;post-line-break&quot; /&gt;
Hope this tutorial helped! It’s been a few months since I did any iOS dev (got caught up in a lot of web dev because of work) so I hope my explanations and code were clear and clean.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>CSS Tips and Tricks August 2017: Flexbox</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been starting to work with CSS flexbox for one of my projects at work that has some very sophisticated alignment, spacing, sizing, and positioning specifications. It’s heavy in animations and must respond dynamically to window dimension changes. One of my co-workers advised that I try out flexbox since it specializes in these types of properties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post will cover the main properties and what they do. For more information, here are some useful resources:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/&quot;&gt;Flexbox guide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flexboxdefense.com/&quot;&gt;Gamification to learn flexbox&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://philipwalton.github.io/solved-by-flexbox/&quot;&gt;Challenges that were solved with flexbox&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;parent-properties&quot;&gt;Parent Properties&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;allowing-flexbox-properties&quot;&gt;Allowing Flexbox Properties&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You must first specify that the div should respond to flex CSS properties by setting &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;display: flex&lt;/code&gt; in the parent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;axis--cross-axis&quot;&gt;Axis &amp;amp; Cross-Axis:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;http://www.flexboxdefense.com/images/flexbox-column-a0e8dc099b07e1cfd6eaa6da2525cf54.png&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-css highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;.container&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;flex-direction&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;row&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;row-reverse&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;column&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;column-reverse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;justify-content-cross-axishorizontal-spacing&quot;&gt;justify-content (cross-axis/horizontal spacing)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;justify-content&lt;/code&gt; property is a fancy way of saying horizontal alignment. You can align &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;flex-start&lt;/code&gt; (left), &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;center&lt;/code&gt; (center), &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;flex-end&lt;/code&gt; (right), &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;space-between&lt;/code&gt; (space items evenly using their widths), or &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;space-around&lt;/code&gt; (space all items so that they have equal space between them).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-css highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;.container&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;justify-content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;flex-start&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;flex-end&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;center&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;space-between&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;space-around&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;space-evenly&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;align-items-across-cross-axisvertical-spacing&quot;&gt;align-items (across cross-axis/vertical spacing)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;align-items&lt;/code&gt; property allows you position a container’s items across its cross-axis — basically meaning vertically. There are three possible values: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;flex-start&lt;/code&gt; (top), &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;flex-end&lt;/code&gt; (bottom), and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;center&lt;/code&gt; (vertically in the middle).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-css highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;.container&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;align-items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;flex-start&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;flex-end&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;center&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;baseline&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;stretch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;flex-wrap&quot;&gt;flex-wrap&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can determine whetehr or not the children are capable of wrapping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-css highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;.container&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;flex-wrap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;nowrap&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;wrap&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;wrap-reverse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;/* default nowrap */&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;child-properties&quot;&gt;Child Properties&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;order-order-of-items&quot;&gt;order (order of items)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This can be set to display the children in an order different from when they appear. It accepts an interger value as its parameter and they are all relative — that is, they do not need to be sequential. Making the first component &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;-10&lt;/code&gt; and the second component &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; has no difference from making the first component &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; and the second component &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;2&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-css highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;.item&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;order&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;integer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;flexflex-growflex-shrink-proportion-they-scale-to-fill-their-container&quot;&gt;flex/flex-grow/flex-shrink (proportion they scale to fill their container)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This property describes the item’s ability to scale and fill the container. Like &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;order&lt;/code&gt;, the numbers are all relative so having an item with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;flex: 1&lt;/code&gt; (or &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;flex-shrink&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;flex-grow&lt;/code&gt; if you want to set them independelty) will scale half the size of an item of the same parent with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;flex: 2&lt;/code&gt;. Negative numbers are not allowed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-css highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;.item&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;flex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;/* default is 0 */&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;flex-grow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;flex-shrink&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>My Custom VIM Configuration: Installation, Usage, and Capabilities</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;configuring-your-environment&quot;&gt;Configuring Your Environment&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VIM is configured using a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.vimrc&lt;/code&gt; file in your root directory (&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;~/.vimrc&lt;/code&gt;) and serves as the configuration file. It is similar to a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.bashrc&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.bash_profile&lt;/code&gt; in the sense that it must be sourced to reflect changes, but VIM automatically takes care of when it launches. Ensure that the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;~/.vimrc&lt;/code&gt; file exists and if not, create one. Now here’s how the complete setup:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Copy/paste the contents of &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/khou22/dev-tools/blob/master/vim/.vimrc&quot;&gt;the configuration file&lt;/a&gt; into your &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.vimrc&lt;/code&gt; file or replace the file itself. This will give you all the configurations that I use. Before you are done, you need to install the packages that are used in the configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Like I said earlier, I’m using &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug&quot;&gt;vim-plug&lt;/a&gt; as my package manager service. Install &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;vim-plug&lt;/code&gt; using:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt; curl -fLo ~/.vim/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs \
     https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Open VIM - type &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;:&lt;/code&gt; to open the VIM command line. You will be using this a lot. Type &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;PlugInstall&lt;/code&gt; and press Enter.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;VIM has a handful of common “listener keys” that let VIM know you are about to perform a custom key command. This includes &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;:&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;,&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/&lt;/code&gt;, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note&lt;/em&gt;: Sometimes need to source the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.vimrc&lt;/code&gt; file first:&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;  :source %
  :PlugInstall
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Install &lt;strong&gt;MacVim&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 Some plugins will require a higher version of VIM than the out-of-the-box built-in default for Macs. Many references online have recommended using &lt;a href=&quot;macvim-dev.github.io&quot;&gt;MacVim&lt;/a&gt; and aliasing its CL interface to “replace” the default. Add this to your &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.bash_profile&lt;/code&gt; after you’ve installed MacVim:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt; # Mac VIM Alias
 alias vim='/Applications/MacVim.app/Contents/MacOS/Vim'
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your VIM is now properly configured to work with the plugins that we have included in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.vimrc&lt;/code&gt;; however, some plugins require additional installations that I will described next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;installing-plugins&quot;&gt;Installing Plugins&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few plugins that require additional installations that don’t get setup automatically using &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;vim-plug&lt;/code&gt;. Follow the steps below to configure these libraries:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;pathogen--package-loader&quot;&gt;Pathogen — Package loader&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;mkdir -p ~/.vim/autoload ~/.vim/bundle &amp;amp;&amp;amp; curl -LSso ~/.vim/autoload/pathogen.vim https://tpo.pe/pathogen.vim
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;ag---for-project-file-grepping&quot;&gt;AG - For project file grepping&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(‘AG’ stands for the silver element in periodic table)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;brew install the_silver_searcher
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;   &lt;strong&gt;Dev Box (Ubuntu)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
   &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;
sudo apt-get install -y automake pkg-config libpcre3-dev zlib1g-dev liblzma-dev
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;youcompleteme---autocomplete&quot;&gt;YouCompleteMe - Autocomplete&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Install Cmake: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;$ brew install CMake&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;On dev box (Ubuntu): &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;$ sudo apt-get install cmake&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;To install Typescript support: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;$ npm install -g typescript&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Finish install: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;$ cd ~/.vim/plugged/YouCompleteMe &amp;amp;&amp;amp; ./install.py --all&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;solarized-colorscheme-for-vim--theme&quot;&gt;Solarized Colorscheme for VIM — Theme&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Install into &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;bundle&lt;/code&gt; folder. Create it if the directory doesn’t exist.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt; $ cd ~/.vim/bundle
 $ git clone git://github.com/altercation/vim-colors-solarized.git
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Set the theme in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.vimrc&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt; syntax enable
 &quot; Use 'light' if want the light theme
 set background=dark
 colorscheme solarized
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creating new file from CL in VIM:
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;$ vim &amp;lt;file-name&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Make sure you save before you quit using &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;:w&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quitting: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;:q&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Quitting without saving (and not being prompted): &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;:q!&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;easymotion&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Easymotion is a plugin that allows you to quickly move through the current file by highlighting all possible next positions for your cursor and adding a hotkey to them. Instead of typing &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/div&lt;/code&gt; and pressing &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; to cycle through to the instance of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;div&lt;/code&gt; that you’re looking for in your code, you can simply type &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;s&lt;/code&gt; to initiate the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;easymotion&lt;/code&gt; grepping, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;di&lt;/code&gt; as your two character query (configurable in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.vimrc&lt;/code&gt; file), and type the key that is placed on the instance of what you’re looking for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Commenting&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
To comment a line you’ve highlighted, type &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;gc&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
To comment a line without highlighting, type &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;gcc&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;explorer&quot;&gt;Explorer&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opening up explorer:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;:Explore&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;:Exp&lt;/code&gt; + &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Tab&lt;/code&gt; to complete it for you&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;o&lt;/code&gt; splits horizontally (opens below)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;v&lt;/code&gt; splits vertically (opens to the side)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;-&lt;/code&gt; Up one level to parent&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;gg&lt;/code&gt; - top of file/pane
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Shift + G&lt;/code&gt; - bottom
Go to line number: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;Line #&amp;gt; + Shift + G&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;using-the-command-line&quot;&gt;Using the Command Line&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can use or view the command line without leaving the VIM environment.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;:!&lt;/code&gt; takes you to a read-only fullscreen command prompt to see your history&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Introduction to VIM: Transitioning to Command Line Text Editing</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m testing out VIM (contractions: “Vi IMproved”) — a command-line editor — to see if I should make the switch from Atom/Sublime to VIM. I’ve been using Sublime since I started developing in December of 2014 and I only recently picked up Atom my senior year of high school back in the fall of 2015. I’ve always enjoyed text editors and have had my fair share of GUI clients: Sublime 2, Atom, Brackets, XCode (although a bit different because it’s not for web), and a handful of others.
&lt;br class=&quot;post-line-break&quot; /&gt;
Up until now I’ve always argued that ext editors are much more useful than terminal editors because of their functionality, power, and customization; I was willing to look over their slow performance and limited upper-bound on configuration. Specifically for work-related projects, I have to develop and write code on my virtual machine in the cloud, meaning that I could either edit from the terminal or use an FTP plugin on Sublime/Atom (meaning I would have to manage double copies of everything). I decided that since it’s the summer, I’d have time to try out VIM and see if I want it to be daily driver during the school year because, I have to admit, it has its major benefits.
&lt;br class=&quot;post-line-break&quot; /&gt;
I didn’t want to start from scratch and thankfully my coworker, Steve Aragon, is a master at VIM and has been using it for the past two years or so. He has a base configuration that he got from a friend of his so I used his a base and added some of my own customizations.
&lt;br class=&quot;post-line-break&quot; /&gt;
I’ll probably end up doing a more in-depth post on my thoughts after using it extensively, but my initial thoughts have been fairly positive. The keystrokes take some getting used to. They’re so drastically different from my daily workflow that it’s difficult to adopt, but I can already sense it becoming more muscle memory. Keep in mind that I’ve been using VIM for probably 6 hours total now — much of which is for configuration — I don’t really have enough time logged to make an accurate review of my experience. I love how fast it is and the extensive customizations that I can make. There are plenty of handy plugins (I’m using &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug&quot;&gt;vim-plug&lt;/a&gt;). I’m sticking with my usual iTerm 2 which is significantly faster than any visual text editor, especially Atom, and I’m able to modify the code on my dev box directly as opposed to syncing it from my local machine.

I’ll probably be fairly confident with my setup by the time school rolls around so I’m hoping I can start developing in VIM for all my personal, club, school, and work projects by the end of the summer. The learning curve is a bit steep, but once I’ve put in some practice I’m sure I’ll be faster than I was on Atom or Sublime. I think the difference is really that VIM is so malleable and lightweight that the you can keep pushing the upper bound of your macros, grepping, navigation speed, etc. — your productivity doesn’t ceiling out like it would on a normal text editor.

        <title>ES6 Tips and Tricks June 2017: Webpack Loaders, Regexes, and DNS Configuration</title>
        <description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;post-subheader&quot;&gt;Using Raw Files with Webpack&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some files that are best used when imported as their raw contents. This includes, but is not limited to file extensions like: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.svg&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.md&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.txt&lt;/code&gt;. For these situations, you must use the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;raw-loader&lt;/code&gt; in your &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;webpack.config&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot; data-lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Load markdown as raw text&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;test&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;sr&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sr&quot;&gt;md/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;exclude&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;node_modules&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;loader&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'raw-loader'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using an &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.svg&lt;/code&gt; file in React:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot; data-lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;svgData&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'./image.svg'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;cm&quot;&gt;/* React render() */&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;span&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;loading&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;dangerouslySetInnerHTML&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;sr&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;post-subheader&quot;&gt;Cleaning up Log Statements&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developers use &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;console.log&lt;/code&gt; statements religiously — it’s the best way of debugging and tracking a browser or computer’s path through the code. One problem that arises is that &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;console.log&lt;/code&gt; statements are accidentally left in, which doesn’t reflect well if the log statements are clearly debuggers, or simply left in commented out. When deploying to production, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;console.log&lt;/code&gt; statements should be removed. Because they permeate every corner of the project, I’ve found it’s easiest to remove them using regexes: Find &amp;amp; Replace. Here are the regexes for finding all lines with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;console.log&lt;/code&gt; statements:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot; data-lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Commented out statements&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;\n *\/\/ console\.log\(.*\)&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Active statements&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;\n *console\.log\(.*\)&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Commented out or still active&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;\n *\/?\/? console\.log\(.*\)&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;post-subheader&quot;&gt;Common Regex Statements&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve started using regexes (regular expressions) more and more in my projects — specifically in Javascript — and I’ve found them very elegant and fun to use. I learned them briefly in class at school, but never really implemented them in full. My &lt;a href=&quot;https://devpost.com/software/sofly-scanner&quot;&gt;hackathon project&lt;/a&gt; did use a bit of natural language processing, however, it wasn’t to a huge scale. We mostly stuck to date and location parsing.
&lt;br class=&quot;post-line-break&quot; /&gt;
Here’s a simple email validation regex match statement in Javascript:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot; data-lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;validQuery&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'email@test.com'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;invalidQuery&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'I am not an email address'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Email regex from: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46155/how-to-validate-email-address-in-javascript&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Notice: uses '/' instead of quotes&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;emailRegex&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;sr&quot;&gt;/^&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;(([^&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sr&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\[\]\\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sr&quot;&gt;.,;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sr&quot;&gt;@&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sr&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;(\.[^&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sr&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\[\]\\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sr&quot;&gt;.,;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sr&quot;&gt;@&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sr&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sr&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sr&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sr&quot;&gt;&quot;.+&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sr&quot;&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;((\[[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sr&quot;&gt;0-9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;]{1,3}\.[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sr&quot;&gt;0-9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;]{1,3}\.[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sr&quot;&gt;0-9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;]{1,3}\.[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sr&quot;&gt;0-9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;]{1,3}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sr&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sr&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;(([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sr&quot;&gt;a-zA-Z&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sr&quot;&gt;0-9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sr&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sr&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sr&quot;&gt;a-zA-Z&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;]{2,}))&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sr&quot;&gt;$/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;emailRegex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;test&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;validQuery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;));&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// true&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;emailRegex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;test&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;invalidQuery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;));&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;post-subheader&quot;&gt;Getting the Current Directory in Javascript&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s really important that you use a reliable path resolving system when configuring your web apps. Packages like &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ExpressJS&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Webpack&lt;/code&gt; rely on file paths to build and serve up your app so it’s essential that the way you get your current directory is reliable. There are a handful of ways of getting your current directory and navigating through it:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Getting Directory&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Default: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;__dirname // Often global — can simply access by calling this variable&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Using environment variables: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;const __dirname = process.env.PWD;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Navigating Files&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;
Use the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;path&lt;/code&gt; library:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot; data-lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;path&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'path'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;join&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;__dirname&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'./client/dist'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Resolves the file path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;post-subheader&quot;&gt;Modifying Local DNS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Computers can easily be configured to change the Domain Name System (DNS). What this means is that you can override and map certain IP addresses to different URL names. For example, at work, I develop on my own Dev Box — a section of a computer somewhere that hosts my files. Because Moat has hundreds of these, it’s not economical to buy a domain name for each box. Instead, they are left unnamed and can only be accessed from the browser using their public IP address. When I’m modifying code, I hook into their private IP addresses. Instead of typing in the exact IP address every time you want to view your code, which is long and can easily be butchered, you can modify your local DNS and map that specific IP address to a human-readable URL.
&lt;br class=&quot;post-line-break&quot; /&gt;
Navigate to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/etc/&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;$ cd /etc/&lt;/code&gt;) — notice it is prepended using a forward-slash, indiciating it is in the base directory. Next, open &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;hosts&lt;/code&gt; using VI, VIM, NANO, or any other text editor. Now modify that file using the following structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot; data-lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Address&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;N&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;12.345&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;67.89&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;admin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;test&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;com&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;01.234&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;56.78&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;test1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;com&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;test2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;post-subheader&quot;&gt;Common IP Ranges&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Private IPv4 address spaces (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_network&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;RFC1918 name&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;IP address range&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;Mask bits&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;24-bit block&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.25&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;8 bits&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;20-bit block&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;12 bits&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;16-bit block&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;192.168.0.0 – 192.168.255.255&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;16 bits&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

        <title>Design Notes July 2017: Useful Tools, Freelance, and Design Systems</title>
        <description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;post-subheader&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve recently started talking to some designers at Moat — Vince Li and Josh Turk (Spelling?) [head of design at Moat] — and they’ve been giving me some really good insight into design at a big company as well as tools for myself to use. I’ve been working on the frontend Analytics engineering team, however, because of the size of the company, we do not do any design work. I’ve taken a liking to talking to designers to see what’s going on with their projects and any tips they might have for starting designers.
&lt;br class=&quot;post-line-break&quot; /&gt;
One of the pieces of advice that I’ve picked up at Moat and specifically with design is from Steve Jobs when he says: “Stay a beginner”. The premise of this is great for design but applies to many different aspects of life. It is the idea that you should remain constantly questioning and relearning. If you approach a problem as a beginner every time, you are bound to find improvements and issues with the current design.
&lt;br class=&quot;post-line-break&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;post-subheader&quot;&gt;Tools&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I talked to Vince extensively about what tools he uses on a day to day for his designing. I mentioned to him that I wanted to get more into natural/organic designs like freehand with more intricate details. He uses the &lt;a href=&quot;https://us-store.wacom.com/Catalog/Pen-Tablets/Intuos-pro/wacom-intuos-pro#/undefined1&quot;&gt;Wacom Intuos Pro Medium&lt;/a&gt; and now uses it instead of a mouse. He highly recommends it for what I want to do, but he said that since the entry price is quite steep, it might be more economical to buy an iPad Pro. He let me use Moat’s iPad Pro since the design team hasn’t really gotten around to using it, and it’s been a really neat experience. I’ve been able to play around with some pretty cool apps and I’m currently debating if I can justify the also insanely high price. I’ll give it a couple weeks to see if I’m just going through a hype phase.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;post-subheader&quot;&gt;About Freelance&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Josh worked freelance for about a year and talked about how it’s different from a 9-5 job. He said that working as a designer in isolation is one of the hardest things about it. There’s no one to bounce ideas off of, brainstorm, or even give feedback on your work. He also recommended that freelance work, in general, should be intended to build a consistent stream of work. All too often, you can fall into the trap of building for many different clients with small tasks as opposed to building up a solid relation to a handful (he said about four) brands doing long term work. It’s better when you know the company you’re designing for well and it’s much more rewarding seeing the problem and solution play out over long periods of time. I’ll definitely keep it in mind moving forward seeing as freelance is something that I can imagine myself doing in the future.

&lt;h3 class=&quot;post-subheader&quot;&gt;Design Systems&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of my current project at work and what I’ve experienced talking to designers recently, I really want to build my own design system/pattern/toolkit. Initially I wanted to build my own design system using the &lt;a href=&quot;http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/&quot;&gt;atomic design method&lt;/a&gt; — building buttons, fonts, icons, inputs, etc. that serve as atoms. These atoms then get stacked into molecules, which then stack into organisms, then templates, then finally to pages. It’s a really neat concept and I really want to do it eventually, but because I’m juggling 3 projects (with deadlines) and work right now, I just don’t think I’ll have the hours to devote to it. A more feasible endeavor would be a design pattern, a frontend framework, or a design toolkit — just a way of standardizing the way my buttons, headers, labels, icons, etc. look. Here are a couple of good reference examples:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blueprintjs.com/&quot;&gt;BlueprintJS&lt;/a&gt; - “React-based UI Toolkit”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://patternlab.io/&quot;&gt;Pattern Lab&lt;/a&gt; — An atomic design system&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://getbootstrap.com/&quot;&gt;Bootstrap&lt;/a&gt; — Frontend framework&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/&quot;&gt;Lightning Design&lt;/a&gt; - Salesforce’s Design System&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://material.io/&quot;&gt;Google Material Design&lt;/a&gt; - Google’s Design System&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://design-system.lostmy.name/&quot;&gt;Lost My Name Design System&lt;/a&gt; - A great, clean React-based design system&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://react.semantic-ui.com/&quot;&gt;Semantic UI React&lt;/a&gt; - A Reactified component library&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here are some useful articles on how to make your own:&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Getting Started with Typescript: Thoughts, Tips, and Useful Notes</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I started using TypeScript for my next project at Moat and I have to say I really love it. I’ve always been a fan of type safe language — largely for the compile-time debugging, code completion, and readability — which is why I’m such a huge fan of Swift. TypeScript has given me the structure and safety that I’ve found with Java and Swift, and has reinvigorated my love for web development. I’ve always considered web development to be somewhat of the “wild west” — not too much standardization and with no checks and balances to minimize errors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;post-subheader&quot;&gt;Benefits&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using TypeScript has eliminated a whole category of bugs that would be present in traditional Javascript. I’m using &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;atom-typescript (v11.0.6)&lt;/code&gt; which includes a live linter that checks my code on “compile” rather than during runtime. Because of this, my development time (after I got the hang of some syntax complications) was significantly increased. I no longer had unexpected types, undefined variables, and missing properties on objects. TypeScript can track the type of variables to ensure that functions always receive their specified inputs, variables don’t change types unless explicitly allowed, and code doesn’t attempt to access object attributes that aren’t actually there (also helps with spelling mistakes).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has huge benefits with scalability because of the code clarity and readability. Deciphering poorly written code is a nightmare, but if it had type safety, using the interfaces alone would provide a good map of what’s going on. Furthermore, you wouldn’t have to spend ten minutes to trace the shape of the return object on a function. Team members could better understand the input and output of your code making compartmentalization and modulation a lot easier and more natural.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;post-subheader&quot;&gt;Drawbacks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the major drawbacks to TypeScript is efficiency. For small scale projects without many complicated objects and nested types, TypeScript might slow your development time down. TypeScript excels in complicated projects where you or a team member must use a complicated object with doubly nested arrays, objects, and dictionaries. This is where knowing exactly what variables you will have at your hands is a lifesaver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TypeScript can also be annoying when the type you expect to receive either doesn’t or varies. Even though you can “turn off” type safety by either not declaring a type or using &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;any&lt;/code&gt; as the type, it’s still annoying when the linter complains about something that isn’t really within your control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m sure I’ll find many more annoyances after I’ve gotten deeper into it. After all, I’ve only been using it for about a day so I’m probably naive and buying into the initial hype. Regardless, I’m having fun with TypeScript and opinions are better than no opinions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;post-subheader&quot;&gt;Interfaces&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recognized TypeScript’s true power when I was setting up interfaces. Interfaces are like kind of like Structures in Swift without the variable declaration. They do not contain variables or values. Instead, they essentially map out an object’s shape. For example, I’ve been playing around with GitHub’s API for a project and here are two of my interfaces:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot; data-lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Declare shape of repository&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;interface&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;GitHubRepository&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;interface&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;GitHubFile&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;encoding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;someFunction&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;parameter1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;number&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;};&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// someFunction(parameter1: 'Hello')&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also merge and extend interfaces like so:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot; data-lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;express&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'express'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Adds onto the original interface from 'Express'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;interface&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Request&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;express&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Request&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;session&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;username&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I can use GitHubFile or GitHubRepository as a type just like I would with any other variable type. I have the added benefit of code completion now. When I type a variable name of type GitHubFile and press period, a list of properties and their expected type shows up. It enables IDE’s to be much smarter about their suggestions to the point where it’s honestly approaching Xcode level.

&lt;h3 class=&quot;post-subheader&quot;&gt;Basic Syntaxes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Arrays:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot; data-lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;numbers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;Array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;Math&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;random&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Functions:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot; data-lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;getReadme&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Promise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;GitHubFile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;…&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Casting:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot; data-lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;random&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;any&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;Math&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;random&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;number&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;random&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Defining Generics:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot; data-lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// A promise function that declares a GitHubFile as the promise response&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Promise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;GitHubFile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;post-subheader&quot;&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, I’ve been very satisfied with TypeScript so far. The combination of code completion, reduced debugging time, and clean structure has made for a hugely satisfying development process. I’m thinking about refactoring my NodeJS Heroku server to TypeScript just so I can keep using it. Hope this post was helpful and I highly recommend you give TypeScript a shot!&lt;/p&gt;
