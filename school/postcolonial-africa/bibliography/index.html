The purpose of this source it to provide us with another example of Africa as depicted by Hollywood, and analyze it for it’s cultural validity and authenticity. The writer of the story is a man named Edgar Rice Burroughs, an American with a very Western viewpoint who never visited Africa before completing his story, “Tarzan,” based off the famous European fable. The directors of the movie are also both white Americans males, hinting at the idea that the film as a whole had very little influence from any African perspectives or viewpoints. Because of this, it is suspected that the movie is not entirely culturally accurate. &nbsp;</span></p>

Her dissertation work investigates how race and gender inequalities inform the production of culture in major Hollywood studios, making her a prime source to help us explore cultural representation in modern cinema. More specifically, this journal details patterns that Erigha has discovered in the way Hollywood showcases women and racial/ethnic minorities. The author develops a theory that white males have almost exclusively written the cultural myths that compromises cultural production. Her theories are vital to our research as they provide us with a view of how Hollywood depicts certain cultures on a more broad scale, zooming out from our previous focus on the representation of Africa. &nbsp;</span></p>

Although the post was made on a public blog, I believe his status at the New American Foundation makes his ideas more valid. This article is an argumentative piece he wrote critiquing the 1999 Disney movie “Tarzan.” More specifically, he analyzes the movie in accordance to its cultural accuracy and compares it to the original European fable that the film was based on. This viewpoint is vital to our project as it provides us with a lens by which to interpret Hollywood’s perception on the story of Tarzan, and see how they changed it to either depict Africa in a more or less accurate manner. This is important because it shows us how Hollywood is attempting to display Africa and its vast culture to the young audience that they are marketing for.&nbsp;</span></p>

These comical individuals must learn to adapt and survive in what they see as the “wild.” This is one of the movies we will be analyzing to show Africa’s portrayal in Hollywood media. This movie is especially relevant because it is a kids movie and is therefore responsible for molding a child’s perception of Africa. We will use it as a primary source to examine how Hollywood can subconsciously embed stereotypical ideas about Africa in western culture. Although it was not intended to deliberately create a construed image of Africa, it does it all the same. It is evidence for our argument that movies can impose skewed understandings about Africa from an early age.</span></p>

It depicts the same four New York zoo animals in their attempt to leave Madagascar for New York. They crash land during their journey and become stranded in an African wildlife reserve. There are many elements in this movie that reveal Hollywood’s racist depiction of Africa; more so than the first movie. We will use this primary source to dig deeper into not only the Madagascar series, but Hollywood kids movies in general. Many of the stereotypes are subconscious and presented as humorous. We will examine the effect of this on adolescence psychologically.</span></p>

We chose this article because it covers a large range of movies including “Madagascar” — a film we will be examining. We will use this source to connect what we see in each movie to the larger Hollywood industry. Rose surfaces many of the psychological impacts of these types of movies and uses various examples from movies to support his claims. It is an almost entirely opinionated piece, but creates an argument very logically and rationally.</span></p>

The film takes place in the savannah in Africa and was released in 1994. This is the third of the movies that will be analyzed to depict Africa’s portrayal in films that are focused on a youth audience. The writers of “The Lion King” are all American, and it was the first Disney film to be an original-film (not based on a book). This film will be strong evidence for the racist undertones that were not intended, yet have large impacts on children nonetheless. Some of these aspects include language, the depiction of Africa’s geography, and character portrayal.&nbsp;</span></p>

Similar to Feliza Casano’s piece, it underlines the producer’s decisions concerning color, how it is represented and how it reveals racial stereotypes in the film. It also explores the important position Disney has in the transmission of cultural messages to children all over the world. We will use this argument to strengthen our own claim that movies directed towards youth have a particularly strong influence over children&#39;s perception of Africa.
